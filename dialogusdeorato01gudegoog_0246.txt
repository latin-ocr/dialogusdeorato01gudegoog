must have been ‘quamquam utilia . . utiliora tamen,' for this passage at
least (leals with one and the same topic. The present chapter treats exclu-
sively de voluptate oratoria. 1 have no doubt that Tacitus wrote: quam-
quam quae diu seruntur atque elaborantur grata, gratiora tamen ‘ Although
those things which have been sown and cultivated for a long time are
pleasing (because of their maturity) yet more pleaaing are’ etc. The
changes called forare of the easiest description. quoe (1)) was accidentally

see also Buecheler, at. Mas. XI, 512 f. Graio dropped out owing to the
following gratiora. As for αιια, omitted, he it observed, in two MSS, it is
clearly the corruption of a dittography of dia, the d being mistalren for al,
just as in analogous instances d stands for ol e. g. c. 21=reddent (CD)=
redolent. ln lior. Ep. I 10, 37, Haupt (Opusc. 111 47) conjectured victo
ridens for victor violens. The change finally of ‘a’ and ‘e’ into ‘u' and
‘a' in tho verbs can hardly he called a correction. Perhaps we ought also
ιο read laborantur for elaborantur, cf. c. 30 2 and note to c. aas, but this
is not absolutely necessary. —On the comparative following closely upon
