lu dno kim-ny eommunioaoed to me the vnluable glennings uf
his recollation of the Vaticani. As 1 have been compelled ιο
dissent from Andresen‘s opinions more frequently than from
thone uf any uther scholar, it may not be out of place ω state
that the detailed attention everywhere wem-ded ω his views is
intended as a sineere tribute to the high rank which he
daservedly oeeupies among 'tacitam scholam oi to-day. John's
contributions have also been a great help to me, and I nm the
more glad to make this aeknowledgment, because his learned,
acute and instruotive notes have hitherto not received the
recognition which they merit.

Iu conclusion, I can but imvdequaoely ncknowledge the

kindly favor-ed me with many valunble suggestions, but hus
also with the greatest care read every line οἱ proof in its
various stages.
