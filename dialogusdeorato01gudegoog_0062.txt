(3) That this date, examined in the light of the ascertainable
facts oi the life of Tacitus, is free from all chronological or inter-nal
objections, and therefore no obstacle to the assumption that the
Dialogus was written by the author to whom the MSS. assign it.

(4) That the Dialogus and the admittedly genuine writiugs of
Tacitus reveal an attitude of mind and heart in the judgments and
criticisms passed upon men and mensures so remarkably similar, as
to be explioable only on the supposition of identity of authorship.

(5) That by the side of palpable stylistic divergencies, there
exist equally palpable coincidences.

(6) That these differences in no sense militate against the genu-
ineness ot the Dialogue, being demonstrably the necessary result of
certain natural and well ascertainable causes which combined to
shape as well as to change or even to destroy many stylistic
features characteristic of the earliest publication of the future
historian.

Under these circumstances, we might be free to dispenso with a
discussion of the rival claims of Qururrmnu or of mer run
Youncnn to the authorship ol the Dialogue. But inasmuch as
their cause, notably that of the former, has from the days of
Lipsius found staunch adherente among scholars of reputo, we must
needs enumerate, as briefly as possible, the reasons on the basis of
which their case would have to be summarily rejected, even if the
Tacitean authorship of the Dialogus were less firmly established
than it is.

The Plinian hypothesis ¹¹³ need not occupy us very long, for the
reasons which Nast, Hess, Wittich and Kramarczik have advanced
are either ridiculously absurd or absolutely gratuitous. The spuri-
ousness of the treatise was of course taken for-granted and the
numerous insuperable obstacles in the way of their theory persist-
ently and disingenuously ignored. We are told, among other things,
that the dramatic date of the Dialogus admirably agrees with the

ascertainable data in Pliny's life, that Pliny was by virtue of his
oratorical training and talents peculiarly fitted to discuss the prob
lem dealt with in the Dialogus, that in lact the method of treatment
of thc subject is quite in the manner known to us from his corre·
spondencel Fabius Iustus als0, to whom the treatise is addressed,
