Mss. Michaelis having, upon very slontler grounds, as we shall
see, pronounced iu favor of the superior validity of tho X class
(AB), argued that D, which often forsakes its family for the read-
ings of AB or B alone, must be regarded, in spite of the carelessness
with whioh it was written, ns the must trustworthy apographon of
the mhetypon of Y⁴ C he placed next in value, but innsmueh ss
it osten agrees with E, where D eoincides with AB, he conclude-i
that the variants in GE must be due to interpolation and conjecture,
and not to the common parent of DCE. E, Michaelis asserted, was
a direct offspring of C, but ae it in turn frequently eoineided with
A as against C, these divergences could only be explained on the
hypothesis that it had been subsequently corrected out ox* A or
some member of this family. Finally, Δ is brought into close
relationship to C, both having been copied from a brother οἱ D.
Michaelis’ stemma is therefore this:

mphon of C, Michaelis himself furnishing the proof, for, on p. xvi
