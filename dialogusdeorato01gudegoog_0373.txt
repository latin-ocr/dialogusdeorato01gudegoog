been put into the mouth of Aper, is it were true, as Reum, De
Quint, tum qm· suit da causis 0077. etoq. p. τι contendo, that the
Dialogus was mitti-n shortly before the death of Domitian, i o.
after the publication of the Institutio, for we there read X 1, 115

cists had not yet taken place at the time when Aper's words ure

of any anachronismis in the Dialogus, there will have been an
interval of nearly twenty years between it and Quintilian’s remark,
a period suffleiently long to allow of the variationis in oratorieal
criticism here implied. On hoo meo, ef. o. 4 1.—quetus quisqu·
