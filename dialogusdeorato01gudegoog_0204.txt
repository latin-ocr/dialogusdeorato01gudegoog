tion is common (ε, g. Cic. de orat. 1 53, 228 Brut. 2, 9 Uise. V 31,

term denoting merely the power by which we are euabled tu repro-

passage. lt will be admitted that *somnam sui quisque et animi et
ingenii redderent' is intended by the author to apply to all the
interlocutum, but this necessitates the further inferenee that Aper
is included among the singuli. If so, we cannot properly supply
corruptae eloquentiae after musas, for Aper vehemently denies
the very proposition. Andreseu's explanation that, as far as Aper
is cancel-ned, ‘der Begriff des Verfalls der Beredsamkeit zu dem der
Veranderung erweitert wird’ involves a kind of zeugma which
eannot be accepted without parallel ins-tannes. This difficulty is
avoided by supplying some such expression as 'immutatae eloquen-
tiaery 011 this point all the speakers are agreed. ‘nivel-sas* has
the meaning of ¹ var-iousss not 'opposite ’ (mit Runksicht auf Apers
Standpunkt Andresen), sor Aper's attitude is not made known till
