annot be assigned ιο οπο sinqle speaker, be his nnme Messalla,

Another theory wns sdvaneed by Heumann, who contended that
n lacuna must be assumed aster the words 'faves ulmuvebantss
because of the want of any organic connection with whnt follows.
The words cited he regarded ae the close of Memzlla't argument,
while the remia-ier was assigned to Maternus This view did not
find e ehmpion till Becker-¹⁶¹ strongly advocated it a century inter,
with the mndifiestion, however, that he too assumed the preceding
speaker ω have been Secundus, his grounds being similar to those
sdveneed by Steiner. But this explanation was also uegleeted or
rejected, until Andrum, fifty years still later, egnin returned to the
original hypothesin of Heuniann,¹“ adding, what his predecessore
had failed. to do, s. few passages as evidenee of the centradietory
thember between the two parts. Finaliy the whole question was
taken up nnew hy Hau-02⁶· who in turn argues in favor οἱ Becker's
solution of the problem*

The great majority οἱ editors and critias, however, obstinately
hold to the view thet everything from e. 3ss to 42 was spoken by
Maternus, some of these elinging to the belief ssiat Secundus did
not spes-k at all,¹“ while others maintain that he (lid so, but that
his eontribution to the debete, together with the close of Messalla’s
argument and the beginning of Maternus’, was lost in the lneuua,¹'¹
which they in consequence assume to be one of considerable
magnitude.
