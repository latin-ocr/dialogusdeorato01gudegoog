Mttller, followed by Woln and Andresen, ingenlously conjectured ‘qua
quasi corninus nisus’ on tlre analogy ol Tac. dnn. lv bl adversum resi-
stentis corninus niti fatetur. But ‘qua’ ior ‘si’ ls not called lor, as has
been shown, uor ls ‘quasi’ needed, ior Tacitus and other post-Augustsu
writers lreely dispeuse with apologles ior unusual metaphora See E.
Wolll, Eioleit. p. 141. ‘nisus' ls also superfluous, forI cannot seo why
‘cominus' may not have the meaning which was given to lt above. Finally,
lt ls intrinsically improbable that three words were omitted ln the MSS.
Nissen’s easy ernendation ‘cornmlnans,' revived by Vahlen, is, in my J'udg·

the Dialogus, though exceediugly common iu the other writings of
Tacitus. See Lex. Tac. p. 882l-8830. It seems to occur first in

habitually grouped together as rnarking the zenith oi oratical great-
ness in antiquity. Cp. tlre beautiful antithesis in Hieron. ad
Nepot. de rita cleric. : Demosthenes tibi (sc. Ciceroni) praeripuit,
ne esses primus orator ; tu illi ne solus. - Aeschines et Hyperides
et Lysias et Lyeurgus: The names oi the Greek, as well as those
of the Roman oratore, enumeratod immediately below, are not
arranged chronologically, but in the order of merit. Quint. X 1, 76
agrees with this critical estimate: Decem (sc. oratores) sirnul Athe-
nis aetas una tulit quorum longe princeps Demosthenes . . . Aesch.

The editors ottho Dial. have with singulm unanimity rejected ‘autem'
before ‘locum' lt is, however, eminently proper in this place, as shown
hythe sircceeding symrnetrically constructed clause: Cicero ... Calvus
