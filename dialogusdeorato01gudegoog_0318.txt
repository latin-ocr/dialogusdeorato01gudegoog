‘h'on . . . contemnere' is erroneously taken by Michaelis, Peter, aud
earlier editors as a question implying surprise or indignation, the iuterroga-
tive particle being, as often iu such cases, omitted. This view is, however,
clearly reiuted by the following ‘nam' clame. Baehrens, lollowed by
John, reads ‘numquam' but this emendation seems also superfluous, aad
is, moreover‚ somewhat inconsistent with ‘saepe’ ior which we should
rather expect ‘sempen’ i. e. ‘You aecer cesse, etc, ior I continuatis hear
this kind oi talk irom you'

informers and legacy hunters in the reign of Nero andei Domitian.
The occurrence alluded is known to us only from Tac. H. [V 42
magnam eo die pietatis eloquentiaeque samam Vipstanus Messalla
adeptus est, nondum* senatoria aetate, ausus pro fratre Aquilio
Regulo deprecari. Regulum subversa Crassorum et Orfiti domus
in summum odium extulerat. Sponte accusationem subisse iuvenis
admodum nec depellendi periculi sed in spem potentiae videbatur.
igitur Messalla non causam neque reum tueri sed periculis fratris
semet opponens flexerat quosdam. He was acquitted by Vespasian
and died in the reign oi Trajan (Plinvi 2). Pliny frequently speaks
of him, but always with supreme detestation and indignati0n‚ e. g.
l 5, 14 Regulus, onmium bipedum nequissimus (quoted from a letter
oi Modestus) 112011Υ 2 VI 1, 4 ‘bene iecit it. quod est mortuus;
melius si ante.’ hla1·tial,on the other hand, exhausts his copious

vocabulary to extol the virtues arrd oratorical accomplishments oi
Domitian’s poweriul friend. Cf. Marti 111 IV 16 V 63 VI 38. 64.

‘antiquis' is unintelligible, and is very probably the gloss oi some ancient
reader who, asJohn observes, took ‘contendere' in the sense oi ‘comparare'
The attempta to retain the word hythe insertion oi ‘prae' or ‘parem’
ignore the pregnant use oi ‘orator' (on which see c. l e). ‘Atque id eo’ is
palaeographically improbable. The missing conjunction is supplied by
reading coque, ‘que’ being easily dropped, owing to the similarity in sound
oi the letter immediately following. Cl. c. 41 11 obscurior gloria ior
