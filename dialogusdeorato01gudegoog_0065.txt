in the Dia-logne, hut 00qu not, from their ’very nature, have ever
occurred in it, ns they deal with the inulte of ““ elocutio ’³ proper,
euch ne the κακόζηλον, hyperbole md the like.¹¹' But if κο, we ue
put upon the horne of a dilemma. of which it would be hard to any
which in the more absurd- For either Quintilian wrote a. book ‘ de
causis corruptae eloquentia& and the Dialogus de oratoribus, but
by some strange accident repeatedly referred to the former only, ot
elne the two nm identioal, the nuthor’e cintionn being by nn equally
strange accident absent {rom the extant treatise ¹¹¹—which had no
plnee fm- them nnywhere 1

‘rhu remaining argument« adduoed in favor of Quintilian partein
to the matter and the snm of the Dinhgue, the treatiee revenling,
it ie contended, no many elementa in common with the Institutio
Orawrin ns ιο esmblish identity οἱ authorehip beyond question*

Now u regni-dn the contente of the two worke, there ean be no
possible doubt, aa we may nt once admit, that many und even
striking points of resemblance exiet, and they have been duly noted
in the Commentary,¹’² but this fact can in no sense justify the
inferente that han been drawn, for the following reasons :

(1) Similarity ol subject mutter necessarily leads ω similarity in
its presentation.

(2) Very many of the coineideuees collected by the writers
mentioned are not peculim· to Quintilian, but may be readily paral-
leled from other authors, notably Cicero, to whom both Quintilian
und Tacitus ‚are alike lnrgely indebted. This in equally true of the
numerous aesthetie criticisms of litei-ary men, upon which uudue
nti-ess has been laid, for here, if anywhere, tho great rhetorieian in
almost wholly dependent upon earlier sources, not only in Greek,
bnt to some extent even in Latin literature, where we certainly
might have expected greater independence mul originality.¹¹¹ These
judgmentn haal in course of time become stereotyped ami common
