The false conception ooncerning the relationship of om· MSS. is
primax-ily responsible for the opinion of Michaelis, followed by au

Selneuen-‚ffl¹ thal: ΑΒ, by reason of their more faithful xeproduetion
of the nehetypom possess the greater vulidity. But this view id
erroneoufl. We may rendily admit that the common arehetypon of
AB was written by a less learned scribe than the parent MS. of Y;
he certainly was far inferior to the copyist οὶ the latter in mlv-ing
the many compendia, which unquestionably were a cluneteristic
feature of their common prototypa It also goes without saying
that a merely nnmem'ml preponderanee of genuine reading! iu nne
m· the other family does not in itself constitute a valid claim to
superiority, unless the nature οἱ the variants themselves wax-muts
such nn inference. On the other hand, it is nu lese zrue that a
MS. which falls repeatedly to give what the author munt have
written, and iu which the scribe, im· the sake oi* aldvish adbel-enee
to his copy, diseards the genuine reading close ae hand, ought not
to be made the sole basis οἰ the recension os um tex& It is one
