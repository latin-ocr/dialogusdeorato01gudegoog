Senatus eonem-rexit et prosequebatur Catonem in carcerem. Hac
invidin faeta, Caesar destitit et mitti Catonem iussit! The first
attempt at 'closum ³ with a view to eheeking this nbuse was made
by the lex Pompeia de vi et ambitu (52 κα), mentioned e. 38 ὃ,
where see note. Cp. Mommsen, Riim. smum. 111 919. 934. 985
Lange, Rffm. Alta-m. 11 384. lez—By these long-winded speeehea
we ean strictly, it would seem, understand only those delivered iu
the ‘comitia’ for, if we include the senate, ⁴ pop. ut impu-itmj is out
of place, it the law murts, 'diem dicendo eximere’ is inapplicable,
because the time allotted to speakers in ajudicial trial was appar-
ently limiwd by the clepsydra, at least as far back ns 70 n. c. (Cic.
Verr. 1 9, 25 legitimae horae). Cp. Mnrqunrdt, Privatleh. ³70 ff.
sinim, Βία. Ant. 1 775. On the other hand, it is not probable that
Aper's remark should, ful· no apparent reason, have been inten-
tionally confined to the oratoru iu the comitia, We must, therefore,
add this passage to the examples of ineonsisteney enumerated in
e. 3 m-En-fmaereae and «namna (below) in the protasis, the aps>
dosis being usually in the imperf. indicative, are subjunctives of
indefinite frequeney. This construction is extremely rare in pre-
Ang. prose. ln Cicero only de orne. 1 54, 232 eme eninr Athenis
reo damnato, si fraus capitalis non esset, quasi poenae aestimatio,
but hel-e Sorof, followed by Wilkins, assume an oratio obliqua.
There is an indisputable instance, however, in Caes⁴ Β. G. V35
sin . , . tenere vellent . . . relinquebatur, and Livy furnishes a
number of exulnples. In Silver Latin, finally, this so-called itera-
tive suhj. is most frequent in Suetonius and quite common in Taci-
tus. Cf( ll⁴ 149 11 5 IV 1 Arm, 11 57 111 69 1v 7. 46 V 11 VI
30 XV 45. Cp. Dr. H. S. 11 733 Stl'l p. 77 f. (who omits nur pas-
sage), Hoffmann, Zeitpnrtikeln p. 52 ff* —longt principiorum pno-
