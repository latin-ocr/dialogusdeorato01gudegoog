sage is a reminiscence from Horace. See below.

1 cannot agree with Baehrens (Comm. Gru. p. 98) and John ad loc. that
the clauses 'ros. . . essent’ and ‘deus . . mutasset' express an alterna·
tire, for this would not only require ‘ct’ for the second ‘aut' and 'aut' for
the first 'ac,' but also the deletion of ‘tempora’ John, moreorer, himself
admits that the first no less than the second miracle could only bc realised
by divine intervention. The second clause is, in my judgment, simply a
varied reiteration of the preceding, as in c. 384 nemo intra paucissimas
perorare horas and modum in dicendo sibi quiaque sumebat. The deletion
of the entire clause ‘deus . . . munisset' seems to me equally unjustifiable‚
ior, though the Horatian parallel might have been recalled by some ancient
reader, it is not sufficiently similar to have suggested a marginal gloss or
interpolation in the form in which we find it in our passage. —oestrm as its
position shows, is quite out oi place. It was originally written above the
line, being subsequently introduced into the text.

It is inconceivable that Tacitus put this advice into the mouth of
Maternus, if the sarnc speaker had delivered the eulogy on the

sense, ‘sacculum' as in c. 1 l is synonymous with ‘aetas’ and

42. 1 cum Messalla: ‘inquit’ is omitted as in c. 41 251 281.
—quibus contradicerem: Messalla the uneourprornising ‘laudator
temporis aeti’ was not likely to acquiesce in the opportunistie
doctrine adroeated by Maternus in c. 41. It is to this chapter
that ‘si qna obscura’ alludes
