Μὴ* The acenery ot tha Dialogus is laid in the house of tha poet

Curiatius Maternus. One aftemoonffl of the year 74]Ὶὸ Am.. pre-
sumabiy in the winter, ss the conversation takes place in—doors,
Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus, two intimate friends, accom-
pauied by a devoted diseiple, the youthful Tacitus, call upon their
mutual friend and to their surprise find him reading the very
tragedy which he had tlie day, previous recited and which had,
ss we are told, given offence to the ‘powers that be,’ because of
some pronounced liberal sentiments put into the mouth οἱ Cato
Uticensis, the hero of the play. Secundus deprecatos the out-
spokenness which the poet has injudiciqusly thought fit ιο display,
and Aper endeavors ιο impress upon him the necessity υ well as
the expedieucy of entirely abandoning so precarious and useless a
pursuit. particularly us it must seriously interfere with his forensia
duties. Maternus in reply, to the evident astonishment of liis
visitors, expresses his unalterable determination to withdraw en-
tirely from the forum and the law-courts, and ιο devote himself
hencefortli exelusively ιο the cultivation οἱ the Muses.

This announcement*naturally lenuis to n discussion between
Maternus and Aper, touching the inti-insic valuc and respective
superiority uf oratory over poetry, Secundus having pnlitely but
firmly declined ιο εει-ι as unipiie, because οὶ inerndicuble prejudiees

by a. not nnuomtnun drematic device, borrowed in tliis instance
