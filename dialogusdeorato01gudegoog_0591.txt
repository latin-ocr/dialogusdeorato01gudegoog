IN COLLEGE SERIES OF LA TIN AUTHORS.

Owing to the lack ol an annotated English edition, the Dialogus ot Tacitus
has hitherto been practieally inaccessible to the studente oi American and English
colleges. In foreign schools the work has long been highly prized, and itis well
worthy ot a place in our own higher education.

Great paine have been taken in this edition to incorporate the results oi the
most recent textual and exegetical studies on the Dialogus. special attention has
been peid to the languege in its relations to prae-Augustam standards on theone
hand and to Tacitus's later works on the other. An introduction treats oi the
disputed authorship oi the work, ol the interlocutors, the language and style, the
date oi composition, and the course ol thought. Α critical appendix and indexes
accompany the volume.
