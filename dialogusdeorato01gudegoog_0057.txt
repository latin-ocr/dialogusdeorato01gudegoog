of m over-ingenious subtlety of annlysis, are but called forth hy the
infinite atylistio capabilities of the languagea themselves. Thnt
omwry and history, with which we m here more immediately
comem-i, demand different rhetorical treatment, is paniolum-ly
emphnised in a well-known passage of the younger Pliny.mr

These tvo causes, then, tho psycholoyfoal and the rheam-icat, taken
in eonneotion with the long interval of years that hal-l elapsed
between tho puhlicniuu of the Dialogus md the larger historiam
witings, would iu themselves bo sufficient to mount ior the
utylistie change which confronts us.

An exmination, however, of tha Agricola. md the Germania, Geadic
which ure chronologically intermediam between the Dialogus anni 'mmm
the Annals, shows that still a thir-i faetor had its share in effenting
the cha-nge under notive. For we observo that the Agricola and
the Germani» have still many stylistio features in common with
the Dialogus which nne would look for iu vain in tha subseq-lent
writings. Again, not a few characteristic usages, still rare in the
Dialogue, meur with constauely increasing frequeney in the later
woxks, while others common in the Dialogus show a oorresponding
deerease, often disappearing entirely iu the Annals. In other
words, the style of Tuscilius, aa it is revealed to us iu its πωπω-εει
md latest form, is to a considerable exuent the result of a ymmo
denelapmant, passing gradually zhrough various phases of gruwth or
doeay, which we ars osten still able to truce. This fact, thanks ιο
Woelfflin, is now all but universally admitted,¹⁰¹ mni ie will! there-
fore, suffice sor our present purpose to illustrate the point by
uhu-cing a few salient examplesst‘*
