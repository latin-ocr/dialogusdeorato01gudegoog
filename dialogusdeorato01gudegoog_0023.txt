Raase’s vain-able eammentztio de Taciti vita, ingenio, seriptis,
Franz Weiulwuff published his first dissertation, De Taciti Dizlogo,
with an index eompuativns, which was followed by m index
Latinitatis in 1859. With the appearance of these weighty eou-
tributions, we enter upon a new pha-se of the controversy, charae
terised by ι more or less genera] aequiesosneo in the genuineness
of the Dialogus. Laying duo strsss upon the many remarkable
points of agreement in the general mode of thought aud feeling,
the criticisrus on men and mensures between our treutise und the
historical writings of Tacitus, some of which Lange and Eekstein
had previously collected, Weiuknuff ior the first time instituted nn
exhaustive stylistio and rhetorical ¹¹ oompsrison whioh shewed that
the stylistie resemblanees, even down to minutiae, were more
numerous and striking than even the most ardent advocates of
Taeitean authorship could have expected. Nevertheless, there
were not wanting eritius, like Bernhardy, who still insisted that
these coincidenees were after sll not sufficient to counterbalanee
the equally striking diffamas, and these Weinknuff, like all his
predecessore, had failed to account for satisfactorily. Thnt was
resen-ved ior Eduurd Woelfflin who, in u series oi articles in the
Philologus, beginning in 1868, proved conclusively by a large
number of apt illustratiuns that this stylistie differenee is the
result of a genetie development which we are still able to trane
through the work-s of the histor-ian, *dass in dem Stile des Tacitus:
to use his own words, ‘nieht nur das Individuelle von dem der
Zeit Angehorigen zu scheiden ist, sondern dass das erstere Element
in den fruheren Schriften noch weniger zur Geltung kommt, sich
im weiteren Verlauf des Sehreibens starkt, und dass schliesslich
Tuitus in (len Annalen, wir wellen nicht sageu am besten schreibt,
aber eheu eret der wahte Tacitus ist? '¹

Five years before Woelfflin’s epoch-msking investigations,
Steinds famous ‘Progmmm’ appeared, in which the paramount
vnlidity of the MS. testimony is ior the first time properly em-
remarkable. The quotation under notice were simply called torth by two lost
letner· ol Tacitus, to which Pliny‘· epistla! 1 ὓ und lx 10 are the exunt replloe.
