onwricel achievement which pervedes every line οἱ ο. 38-408
(ιη), esp. 3⁷ ll ἃ), is quite out of place in the mouth of Maternus,
because he expressly xestrains Messalla from indulging in a. similar
sti-ain, regsrding any peuegyric οἱ the eloquenoe οὶ the republican
period aa superfluous. Cp. c. 24 u exprome nobis nen laudationem

desideramusy disertiores esse antiquos, quod apud nie quidem in
confesso est.

Again in c. 36 2³13. 34 ἰ. the indispamaln'lity of eloquence is
strongly maintained, but Maternus cannot well heve ehu-ed this
opinion, for otherwise he would hardly heve bidden fax-ewen to tho
fotum. Maternus accepts the reason for the decline of eloquence
ιε given by the previous speaker, but with this cardinal differenoe.
The ene oontends that e sturdy eloquence, however desii-able, if
possible only under marchio-ml eonditions, is no eompensetion for
a peaeeful eommonwealth with a corresponding oratam-im] retra
gression5 the ether leaves us to infer that he would rejoioe in
a superior orae-trice! development at any eost, though he prizes the
blessings ot peace ne less highly than his friend. Maternus, es

allusion bo en enactment in ene of Pompey's lawa, the discussion
eoneerning the procedure in che law eourts, the attire of advocates,
and many minor iterus 'Eadem ratio in nostra qumque civitate'
proves eonelusively that the same speaker gnve the same reason for
the decline of Greek oramry ns for the Roman* But this exposition
is again unsuited to the poet Manem-is.

It surnishes the true solution, rnorem-er, of the singular eoin-
eidence which Messalla had told his hearers often puzzled him
(c. 15 13 quod quibusdam solacio est, mihi suget quaestionem
etce). The passages dealing so successfully with this perplexiug
problern cannot therefore have been spoken by Messalla. The
