quite iueumpztible with Tacitean uuthorship, is st the same time
irreconciluble with the authorship of «my m ebe, so that we are
put to the alternative of attributiug the Dialogue to the writer to

In the first place, 1 fully agree with Andresen and others that Wrmm in
the view which brings the Dialogus within close temporal proximity &3⁵⁴⁸ ⁰f
to the Agricola and Germania involves a psychological impossibility
(seo also note 28).

A second obstacle in the way of a later (Late was first pointed out,
1 believe, by Steiner (pv 17 fi). ln the introductory chapter, the
author tells us that he intends to reproduee from memory ⁴ isdem
muueris isdemque rationibus, servato ordine disputationis,y s. debete
which he had heard us 2 very young man. Now ou the theory that
these words were written six or seven years after the event
referred to, the statement, though taxing our credulity ιο some
extent, uevertheless remains within the bouniis of possibility. At
any rate. it does not go beyond the wide latitudo which the
traditional usage ot dialogue writers stom Plato to Cicero has
aanetioned. In fact, the prooemium of the Dialogus is unmistak-
ably modelled upon a similar dramatic device of Ciceros* Pluto, it
is truey makes most extraordinary demands upon the meruory of his
Socrates, but he is very eareful to confine the interval between the
discussion and its subsequent «letailed report to very narrow liunits⁴
Iu view of these facts, it may be safely denied that a writer, who
shows himself so admimbly successful in nupsi-ming to a fiotitious
debete the semblance of historical reality, would delilzerately,at the
very outset, disillusionise his readers by calmly asserting that he
was simply retelling from memory, with all aceuracy and minute-
uess of detailv a conversation which he had listened to more than
—tmaenly years previous! Such self-stultifloatiou on the part of
our author is incretlibley aud yet we should be forced to believe
in it. if our treatiso was not written till aster the death of
Domitian.
