the forum, is implored not to waste his strength upon ‘artes levi·
ores,’ lest they incapacitate him for the higher calling of the
orator. Leuitute is used, because the ‘iaculum' (ἄκων, ἀκόντιον) was
eliphi weapon. Cf. Lucian, Anaoh. 32 ext. κοῦφα ἀκόντια.

andresen (Erneud. p. roa) deletes iactu, on the ground that the ΜΒ.
reading involves an absurd antithesis ‘quia diversissimi generis suut leri-
tatis et iactus notiones! But (1) instances of an anelogous inconcinnity
are not rare in the Dialogus, cf. note c. lar and iactu may well hare been
preferred, because of the fondness of our author, aa Wolff ad loc. observes, for
grouping etymologically related or phonologicaily siruilar worda (2) Audre-
sen unforturrately overlooked, aud this is fatal to his emendation, that by
the deletion of iactu, ‘levitas’ is predicated of the discus which was a very
heora missile, as compared with the J'avelin. Cf. Mart xiv 164 pondera
disci. Stat. Theb. VI 649 peridem vix toto curvatus corpore iuxta Ι deiecit

vanescere: a poetic arrd postAug. word, of frequent occurrence
in Tacitus, but comparatively rare in other writers, only once in
Quintilian (IV 3, 8). Cicero uses the corupound evanescere. Cp.
note c. 1 18. On the gradual decay of powers, if neglected‚ see the
remarks of Plut. hu seni c. 16 (p. 592 A-D).

25 ab auditoriis et theatris: Dramatic perforruances were no
longer given irr Rome irr the days of Vespasian, Maternus' playa,
like those of Seneca, being hook drarrras which the author recited
before an audierrce, previous to their publication. Thc fictitious
errcourrters of the drama enacted in recitatiorr-halls are contrasted
with the real contests of the orator iu the for-um. cf. Pliny, Ep.
113. 5 f. Nos enirn qui irr foro verisque litibus ferimur, multum
malitiae . . . addiscimus. Schola et auditorium et ficta causa res
inermiS, innoxia est. For the use of military metaphors as applied
to eloquerrce, cf. Iuv. VII 1ῖ3 ad pugnam qui descendit, and notes
aberit. 26 rofi. 37 ext.

This evenly balanced antithesis is rudely destroyed by et cd cauam,
an irrterlinear gloss to veru proelio which subsequently found its way
iuto the text. hiiihly p. 21 arrd Knaut p. ll have, independently of each
other, deleted the objectiorrabie clause, but editors have refused to attach
