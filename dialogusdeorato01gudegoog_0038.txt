xxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

111ος the age, owing in a large measure perhaps to his own teach-
ing, seemed again favorable to the healthy growth and development
01 a truer eloquenoe. Without this conviction, the Institutio could
never have been penned. Again, 11 the problem 01 the decline 01
eloquenoe had still been a living issue at the close 01 the lst cen·
tury, where should we bave come upon clearer indicatione 01 110
existence than in the epigrams 01 Martial 0110 the 101101001 Pliny,
which so faithfully mirror the intellectual movements 01 1110 time?
Of 0101011001 decadence, 01 corruption—not a word. The historical
works 01 Tacitus himself point in the same direction. In fact, the
amount 01 0110011011 paid by these writers to oratorical achieve·
100010, 1110 high meed 01 praise bestowed upon orators, the very
number mentioned, prove that the decline 01 eloquenoe no longer
disturbed their reflectione.

Now the Dialogus is, in my judgment‚ a special contribution,
perhaps the ablest and profoundest, to this controversy, and hence
it was necessarily written at a time when the question was still
agitating some 01 the best minda 01 literary Rome. But this was
no longer the case at the close 01 1)00111100’0 reign, or 10 that 01
Nerva or of TraJ‘au. The Dialogus could, therefore, 00 more have
been composed at this late (1010, whether by Tacitus or any other
contemporary, than Perrault's Paralleles des anciens et des mo-
dernes 01 Swift’s Battle 01 1110 Books could have been penned in
the days 01 Louis xvi. or George 1. These questions had all been
finally disposed 01 and now figured only in history, typifying
certain intellectual movements 01 an earlier period.⁴¹
