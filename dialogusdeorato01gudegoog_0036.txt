That the Dialogus was published during the latter part of
Domitian’s life has never been seriously maintained* Some
wholars, however (e⁴ g. Vogel, Wolff), have thought it possible that
it may have been written ss late ns 85 Α,ι)., on the ground that the
despotic nature of Domitian had not yet menifested itself in these
earlier years of his reign. This hypothesis is so clearly a inere
subterfuge resorted to for the purpose οἱ escaping the alleged
difficulties found iu the use of 'invenis admodums that we dismisu
it without further comment, especially as Vibius Crispus had
by that time been doubtless restored to imperial favor, if not to hie
former power* Cf. also Peter, Einl, p. 16.

But we may, as already intimated, go one step further, and show
that the Dialogus, ix· written aster the reign οἱ Domitian, would
involvo 8. litei-ary anachronism, the subject with which it eleale
being no longer atheme of discussion in the time of Nerva :md

period 1111,ι11ε oomposition of our treatise, be its author Tacitus or

In scanning the peges of literary history we repeatedly ineot
with certain oontroversies which seem to arise suddenly, one knows
not whence3 gradually they seize upon the miuds of literni-y men,
and 11 battle is waged for some time between opposing factione.
The ultimate outcome is invariably the restitutioni οἱ the 'status
quo'; no side ever gains a decisive victory. Fir-st n cessationi of
hostilities ensues, a truce is declared, n rccuncilintion effeeted or a,
compromise made. The issue is then sorgotten. Only now 111111
then in literary records do we seem to hear a faint echo ns os
distant thunder, remindinb⁷ one of the struggle ol* long ago. Other
questions have suceeeded and pass through the same stages of
growth, oulminatiou and oblivion. We may illustrate this by a
number of concrete exainplcs, In the days οἱ the Sophists aud
Plato, we have the question whether things are νόμφ or φύσῃ.
During the two and a half centul-ies before our era, the discussion
maed floscely as to whether anomaly or mmlugy was the <luminant
faetor in language formation⁴ In the nge οἱ Cicero, Dionysius und
Caecilius we have the controversy ooncerning the respective merite
of the Atticum xind Asianum genus dii-endi* At the close of
