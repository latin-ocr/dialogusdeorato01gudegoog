is the only permissible form in the Dialogus* In the first part of
the Annals, 'rursum’ largely preponderates, while in the last six
books both forms are used in about equa pruportinn. It may bo
doubted, however, whether this discriminatia· was oonwiously
made by the writer. For eur MSS. are very untruatworthy guides
m follow in such matters, and the long list uf exmples cited by
Neue 11 748450 seems rather to establish the presumption that
both 'rursus' and 'rursum' were used promiscuously md without
eonsisteney, although euphonia remane in prose (ep E. Wolff, Dio
Spmchae du Τ. p. 10), or metricui exigeney in poetry may some·
times have deeided the choica of the particular form. The sanie
applies to the use οἱ 'adversus, -um' (ef. c. 4 5) and other similar
adverbs, on which see Neue ΙΙ p. 743 ffi—inquo mnu - . .
