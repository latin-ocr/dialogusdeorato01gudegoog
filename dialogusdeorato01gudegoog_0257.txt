explanation 'they appropriate everything to themselves, thus
acquiring their immense wealtli at the expense of others: mis-
interprets Aper's nttitude toward these two rnen. For analo-
gous passages, see Liv. 111 37 ferre agere plebem plebisque res
and Xen. Cyr.111 3‚2 πένης ι’νη-ήννων ἡδόμενοι τῃ· εἰρήνῃ καὶ φέροντες καὶ
assam: ὅ πίω-ης seron-tgr, and 'rm H. 1 2, 19 (delatores) agerent
verterent cuneta. Observe that the usual order ot this oollocation
common both iu Greek und Latin, is here reversed. So also Homer
E 484 Arist⁴ Nub. 243 Xen. Hell. VI 5, 50. Such vai-intimi is very
characteristic of Tacitus, who seeks to add a touch of novelty to
expressions which had become stereotyped by constant usage.

is habitually avoided (see c. 22 1³ cuni quodam lumine), except in
iormulaic expressions such as eaque de re (c. 2 4) quem nd modum

servi videntur nec nobis satis liberi,¹ it will be plain. even it we
make all due allow-auce for Maternus' unfriendly attitude, that
¹ patientissimus νεῖν cannot refer to the muitum-‘n of these two meu
toward their sovereign. The praise of Vespssinn seems to be
introduced simply by way or apology for openly eharacterising liis
all-powerful friends us the real power behind the throne, a. criticism
which even so mild-teinpered a ruler might be liable to resent.
Vespasian’s great wlerzinee ot uutspokenness is well attested by Ι
Suet. Vesp. 13 Amicorum libertatem, causidicorum figuras ae philoso- l
phorum contumaciam lenissime tulit and Eutr. vn 1³ Offensarum ,

seribing to Seneca's dietum (de ira ΙΙΙ 3ss): vide non tantum anf
verum sit, quod dicis, sed an ille cui dicitur veri patiens sit. ei. ’
