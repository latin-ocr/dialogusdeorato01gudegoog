[Iuga Iac. mu, Halls 1882- It was customary sor wealthy Romans
ω bequeath lagu—ies ω the Emperor in their wius in order to inaure
the carrying out of the other bequests, for, where this cantion was
omitted, emperors such as Caligulas Nero and Domitian (Suet.
Calig. 38 Ner. 32 Dom. 12) often annulled the testament, appro-
priating the entire estate to themselves. Nero, according tu Sueto-
nius l.e., even went so far ss to enact ‘ut ingratorum in prin-
oipem testamenta ad fiscum pertinerent) Maternus, therefore,
sincerely hopes that, rather than submit to such compulsion, his
fortune, unlike the colossal wealth of Marcellus and Crispus of
which Aper had spoken so admiringly (e. 8), might remnin within
moderate limits, so as not to excite the eovetousness of the prin-
ceps. No other writer, it may be observed‚ refers to this practice
more frequently thau Tacitus. Cf. Ag. 43 satis eoustzbat lecto
