2 eedem ratio· · -in nosne qnoque civitate: The same explana·
tion, Secundus says, by which Ι accounted for the supreme excel-
lence oi Attio eloquence, holds good for republican Rome. —That
Secundus had previously spoken of the Greek orators, is made
evident by 'nostra qaoque civitate! A discussion of Greek oratory
might seem irrelevant at first sight; it was, however, foreshadowed
by the remark of Messalla in c. 15 1311. quod quibusdam solacio
est, mihi auget quaestionem quia video etiam Graecis accidisse
etc. An explanation of this remarkable coincidence, after having
once been pointed out, was imperatively called for, and the author
very appropriately assigned this task to Secundus, the scholar and
historiari in the company, but the exposition itself was lost to-
gether with the beginning of his speech.

4 consecuti sunt etc: i. e. although the orators of our day have
also aequired a fair share of influence (op. Aper's speech, esp. e.
84.1iff.)‚ so far as this is cornpatible with tho more regulated
and better organized order of things existing under the present
monarchical governmcnt, still the enciens believed that they
could securo greater personal prestige by following mr oratorieal
career than in any other vacatiori, for arnid the anarchical con-
dition of affairs and in the absence of a single ruler, the influence
of the individuel grew in direct ratio to his ability to cont-rol the
wavering populace by his eloquence.

Ι am unable to see the slightest justification for the many violent
changes which andresen (Errrend. p. iri-129 Criticul appears to his
editi) bas deemed iit to introduce into the text. His argumente rest
partly upon the erroneous assumption thet Messalla is thc speaker, partly
upon the supposition that the subject oi ‘videbantur' is ‘lmrum temporum
omissos: whereas it is clearly ‘antiqui’ as shown by illo. So similarly
in e. 382 illud iorum refers to ‘veteres.'-‘sibi' belongs to ‘adsequi' aud

‘plum' is predicative, the iull comparison having to be supplied as in the
above paraphrase. See also John's note ad loe.
