aud the singulm-ly appropriate grnupiug οἱ authors. Homer and
Demosthenes, by common voment the greatest Greek poet and the
greatest Greek orator, are opposed to Cicero and Virgil, who occupy
the same rank in Latin literature. On the Greek side, Sophocles

associated hy the uniente, ue eontrasted with the orntors Asinius

glowing description of the career of a successful orator, we may
