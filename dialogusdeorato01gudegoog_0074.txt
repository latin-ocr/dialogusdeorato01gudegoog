Marcus Arna, known to us only from the Dialogus, is a man of

a quite different stamp. Born in some Gallio municipality,¹⁸⁹ not
particularly favored,¹⁴⁰ perhaps neglected by the central govern-
ment, he seems to have emigrated at an early age to the imperial
city.¹⁴¹ Haring acquired a thorough rhetorical training and an all-
round education, he soon succeeded, in spite of the obstacles thrown
in the way of a novus homo from a distant province, in reaching
the praetorship. But he too does not seem to have long survived
the debate in which he is given so conspicuous a part; at all events,
he was dead when Tacitus composed the treatise, as is evident from
c, ΜΨ He is not mentioned either by Quintilian, who pays
so glowing a tribute to Secundus,'0r in Pliny’s correspondence‚ and
his name does not appear in our lists of the Roman consuls.

Aper exhibite all the sels-satisfieri complacency and pride of the
successful sels-made man, and is naturally an enthusiastic advocate
and staunch supportet of the existing politica] regime, under which
he was euabled torisa from obscurity to affluence, influence and
fame. His views are tlroroughly utilitarian; wealth and power
command his respect aud admiration, regardless of the moral worth
of their possessor. ‘Corriger la fortune’ is his motto. A manos
a cumbatire and polernical nature,a shrewd lawyer, he does not
shrink froin casuistry, exaggeration and even misrepresentation, if
it suits his purpose.

His oratorical ideal is that of the modern school, as represented

Uebel aus dem unschatzbaren Gut eines iesten inneren Friedens fliesse; in dem-
selben Sinna iu welcheru Tacitus selbst (see p. xli andnote 67). . . die Klage
liber die Gegenwart zu nriissigen pflegt. 1 cannot afford to discuss the aberra-
tion of those critics who hold that the attitude of Maternus in the closing part
of the Dialogus is irreconcilable with his views in the opening chapters‚ an
opinion which reached an absurd climax in the contentiori oi Strodtbeck that
the closing utteranees oi the poet must be regarded as purely ironical l

¹³⁹ c. 10 6 ne quid de Gallis nostris loquar.

¹⁴⁴³ c. 7 ³ in civitate (probably ‘cit-y ¹) minime favorabili natus.

¹⁴¹ He had also been in Britain, as we learn from c. 17 17. but whether this
visit antedates his ‹leparture for Rome or whether he went there in some official
capacity subsequently, cannot be ascertained. The latter seems to me on the
whole the ruore probahle.

‘¹⁴² See p. xxvi. The supposition that he possibly leit Rome shortly after 75,
never to ret-um, is iu my judgrnent quite incompatible with the attitude of a
man whose very being was so inthnately bound up in the city of his adoption,
aud whose appreciation of the rewards oi oratorical success, possible only ina
large city, was so keen as that oi Aper. See c. θ and 9 ext.
