(3) Some utternnees which happen to be found only in the
Dialogue md Quintilian, so far ns they might not have occurred
independently to two writers like Tacitus and Quintilian, may well
ove their existence in our treatise to the fact thnt the youthful
author had heard theru from the living lips of Quintilian, having
either relnsmbered them or taken them from lecture uotes.¹¹¹

(4) There are unmistnkable contradictioni between the Dialogus
mid the Institutio. Cf. e. g. notes to c. ὕ 6 21 7 22 1² 36 ext.

(ὅ) In still other passages Quintilian seems to take direct issue
wilh stntements made in the Diulogue. Cf. e. g. c. 12 ⁵ 2³ 1.

(θ) Tha pulitical tone, which, ns we have seen, is the sama
throughout the Dialogue and the historica] writings of Tnlcitus, is
wholly different in the work of the eulogist of Domitian.

(7) The chronological data of the lire of Quintilis-u are absolutely
incompatible with the theory under discussion! The writer of the
Dialogue was a very young man in 7⁵, but Quintilian nearly forty
nt that time. The author of the tremas tells us that in 75 he
was still assiduously pursuiug his forensic studies under the
gludauee of Aper and Secundus 5 Quintiliany on the other hand, is
known to have been a pupil of Remmius Palaemon (schol. Iuv. VI
451) and especially of Domitius Afer, as he tells us himself (V Τ, Τ
Χ 1, 86). Aper is never mentioned, Secundus rspentedly (Χ 1, 120.
3, 12 ΧΠ 10, 11), but as an intimate friend and oqlml in σφε
(aequalis), and when Secundus und Aper, accompanied hy their
young pupil, pilitl their visit at the house of Maternus, Quintilian
had been for three years or more the occupant of s. prnfessaorship
of rhetoric established by Vespasiunfl‘
