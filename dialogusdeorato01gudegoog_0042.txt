circumstances, prudence and moderatior· must determine our moda

honor and dignity ate not jeopardisedr Men like M. Lepidus?
therefore, L. Pis0,·¹ Memmius Regulus ⁵¹ and above all the historiatis
own father-in-law” receive his uuntinteti applaune. The lives which
these men lived provesy indeed, that there were not a few of
Tacitus' contemporaries who shased his opportunistie views. But,
¹³⁰ far as these have found literary expression in extant uttermees,
the Dialogus is the only work which can be said ιο breathe ι
political atmosphere similar ιο that which per-vades the historical
writings os Tacitum*

Α It is, of course, impossible ω determine with :bsolute con-
fidenue ιο what precise extent the sentiuients expressed hy the
interlocutos refleet the views οἱ the author, for Aper, Secundus,
Messalla and Maternus are unquestionably drawn to the lite, and
their individua] eharanteristies stand οιιι in bold relief; ueverthe-
less, the prominent position assigned to Maternus, the very siguifi-
cance of his own utternnees, and the unqualified appi-ova] which he
is made ιο give ιο Messaiia's explanation of the causes of the
decline of eloquence and to some of the salient features οἱ Secundus’
argument prove eonclusively that the mevadvoeate must be re-
garded as the chief exponent of the writer's persona} convietions,
munh in the same way as the Crassus of the de oratore is the
inouthpieess οἱ Cieero's own views. But if thir inter-enee be eoi-rect,
and it has never been seriously denied, it 111 uf the highett signifi-

of Tacitus und the Dialogus, so fur as they pertain to politieal
opinions, are praetieaily confined to the speeches of Mater-una !
