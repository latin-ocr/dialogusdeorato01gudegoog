infimior-al endings which were hsbitually abbreviated or, by con-
sun'ny single letters, easily misi-eud or illegible in the original.
These erton, because ot their instantly reeognissble origin, are not
apt to perplex the eritic; they possess, in sant, a distinct value, in
that they pennit him, without inem-ring the risk of eonjeetural
audwity, to restore the genuine reading on interna} grounds alone,
even unmimity in the MSS. furnishing no positive indication of
the reading οἱ the arehetypon. Michaelis' statement that D was
written ‘tamquam per somnium' seems justified, when we observe
that it munins no fewer thau 29 omissione (e. 52 7 12 8 29 9 4. 12.

folio pagus), Germa-nis and the Suetonius fragment. It is a beau-
tifully written MS. Lacunae ars indieated'with esre, either by
vacant spaees οι· by marginal notes of the scribe. It was known to
Lipsius, who valued it highly,¹¹¹ as did all subsequam: scholare till
Michaelis dethroned C in favor of AB. The MS. was lost from
view for a long time, until rediseovered by Niebuhr in Naples.¹¹¹
