one οἱ the mnny clear procis ot the ideutity of Tacitus with the
author οὶ the Dialoguefl

Fun of enthusiesxn fer the sublime oratorical achievements οἱ
his countrymen, he represents, in pointed contrast to Aper, the
unuomprornising laudator temporis acti who is unable to see in the
eloquenoe of his time unytlning more than a deplorahle corruption
md retrogression from the higher idealr aud the chester models οἱ
the republican period. This remarkable change he primarily
attributes to the prevailing laxity of home training and the per-
nicious educutional metliods of contemporary rhetorical schools,
which totally unfit the young and ambitione aspirant to forensie
reputation fur the practicnl duties of his profession. The close οἱ
Messalla& argument is unfortunately lost in the large lacuna efter
c. ³5. In what follows, quite a different subject is under discus-
¹ion, which uuquestionahly points to another speaker. Cau hir

The problein here presented is iutimately οι· rather inextricebly m speaker
connecte-i vm. eho question whether the existence of another⁰s ‘'³⁰⁴⁴“
lmuna, not indicated in the MSS, must be maumeth and this in
turn depende upon the degree of homogeneity inherent in these
elosing chamere, a point ou which critice even to this day widely
differ. The problem is rendered still more complicated by the fact,
thet even those scholare who postulate :i second lacuna are not
agreed as to the place in the text to which it must be assigned,
some holding that the gap occurred before the words ‘Finierat
Maternusl while others insist that it must be placed after ‘admo- ‘
vehant ⁷ (c. ΔΙ 7). Still others deny the existence of any additional *7
lacuna whatever, attributing the whole argument from e. 36-42 to
›ram-nur. Under these circumstances, it will again be expedient,
before discussing what 1 hold to be the true solution of the diffi-
culties, to give e very brief historical survey of the pheses through
which this controversy hae passed.

As usual, it was a remark of Lipsius which started the prnblem
on its career, fur to c. 42 init. in the first edition (1574) hein a
haplese moment jotted down these words: 'Hinc colligere est
