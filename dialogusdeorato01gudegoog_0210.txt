Τ ln publium 'in public planes! Usually opposed to ‘domff also
to 'in privuto,’ e. g. S⁴ G ds Bacch. neve in poplicod neve in prei-
vatod. Heraeus' (1-1, I 19) distinction between 'in public places'
and ‘in the open street* is struined and unneeessary⁴ For similar
adverbial expressions off 'in’ with abl„ οἱ which Tacitus seems
especially fond, cp. Λ. Gerber, Da usu praep. p. 11 fi-nduotnbnr:
¹attemled, waited upon) So sectari e⁴ 20 14 and ³4 4 hune sectari,
hunc prosequi, and not rare in classic writers Peter taking the
word too strictly in the sense uf 'to ronow: is in consequence
emnpelled to assume a zeugma with clunii, whisshy though slight in
itself, is obvinted by the interpretation just given. For similar
expressions, such as se conferre, applicare, dicare, op. &yffi-nuli
Laeli p. Ε)Δ It will be observml that T, here professes to have still
followed the time-honored mustum, the total extinction of which he,
in n lator chapter (34), deplores. Cf. also Quint. XII 11, 5: fre-
quentabunt vero eius (sc. Domiti Afri) (lonium optimi invenes more
veterum.

8 cupidita: A good example. first pointed out by Woelfflin, to

G. 19Δ 35), the elmi-ter ‘cupido' only once (Ag. 5), In the Histories
we find 'culmum‘ 5 times (Η, 1 1³3 is doubtful) *cupido¹ 31 times.
In the Annnls finally cupido has completely routed its competitor,
nomm-ing 47 times. We find the smne partiality for the shorter
form in Sallust (2323) ln Cicero. however, cupido is used only in
personification, mul Quint. ιω it only twice: vx pn 1³, x 7, ΠΑ
