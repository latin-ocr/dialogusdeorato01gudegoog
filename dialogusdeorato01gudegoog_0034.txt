admitted toa conversation which took place iu the house of a
friend oi his teacherS, yet remained so studiously in the back-
ground as not even to represent himself as joining in the general
laughter at the close.³¹ We, therefore, conclude that uo argument
against the date of composition under Titus, the only date compat-
ible with Tacitean authorship, can be legitimately drawn from the
phrase ‘iuvenis admodum! '

We proceed to the discussion of the second objoetion, that the
Dialogus cannot have been published while Crispus was still living
and in power. It requires but little penetration to see that this
argument, so far ironr invalidating the early date bere advocated,
rather confirma it in a remarkable manner. Vibius Crispus, no less
feared as an informer than Eprius Marcellus, who had to commit
suicide alter being detected in a conspiracy against Vespasian in
79, repeatedly got into trouble under this same emperor (cf. Tac.
H. IV 41. 43). During the reign of Domitian, as we have seen, he
was again in high favor, but under Titus we hear nothing ol him.
See also note c. 8 21. Now what, I ask, can be ruore probable than
the supposition that Crispus was at that tirue in ‹lisgrace, for Titus,
as Suet. Tit. 8 expressly informs ue, hated this whole class of
‘delatores' even going to the extentos prosecuting thern with vigor
throughout his short reign. But instead ol adopting this common·
sense and intrinsieally plausible explanation, which is in perfect
keeping with the necessary prescrurpte'on that the Dialogus is a
genuine work of Tacitus, we are called upon to assume a date
toward the close ol Domitian’s reign, apparently ior no other
reason than that such a supposition would conrpel usto attribute
our treatise to sorne unknown cultured contemporary l⁸⁸ But the
refutationes the objections of‚Andresen and his allies after all only
justifies the inference that the Dialogus may have been written in

⁸⁶ This pernicious mode ol argumentation, which meets us ut every inm in
discussions on the authenticity ol the Dialogus has been so well characterised
by Ritschl, Opusc. 143, that 1 cannot refrain from reproducing his protest
here: ‘⁶ Man wetteilert den Bericht des rllterthunrs zu verdachtigen, als wenn
von vornhcrein die Aulgabe galae sich eines wirlerstrebenden Zeugnisses um
iodea Preis zu entledigen, wlilrrend doch alle Grundsiitze historischer Kritik die
Sacbe gerade umzukehren und eine vlelverbtirgerte Ueberlieierung festzuhaltcn
gebieteu, sobald sie erstcns in sirh selbst vernilnltig zusanrnreuha'ngt und
zweitens durch anderweitige Bedenken und Gegengritnde nicht crschi‘rttert
