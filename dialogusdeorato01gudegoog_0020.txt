Quintilian wrote the Dialogus er neither ei them did! The garnut
ef possibilities had, however, net yet been run, and accordingly we
find that there were net wanting seme ‘scholare' who pushed the
elaims ei Suetonius and evenes Messalla and Maternus! That
ne ene should have espoused the cause ef Aper er Secundus may,
under the circumstances, well excite eur astonishment.

But the elaims ef Quintilian and Pliny te the authorship ef our
treatise‚ having been exposed as worthless‚ the sceptics, forced te
cencede their ignorance ef thc real author, were now content te
attribute the work te seme anonymeus cultured contemporary.⁸
Thus the question, after traversing many bypaths, had returned te
the point, where Lipsius' ‘nen liquere' had placed it, and se even

Trinacia (1835), te whom we owe a masterly discussion ef the
entire controversy, after successfully refuting mest ef the arguments
against Tacitean authorship, closes by saying ‘summam superesse
difficultatem in dicendi genere a Taciti usu plane abhorrente
positam, quare tetam rem, dum meliora preferuntur, in medie
relinquendam esse censuimus! The mest persistent and obstinate
advocate ef the ‘anonymeus' theory was H. Getrinann (1830). He
again emphasised the stylistie objections, but went beyond his pre·
decessere by contending that the style shewed evident signs of a
decadence in teste and that the matter, barring perhaps the chapter
en the edueatien ef children, was unworthy ef Tacitus. ‘³ Der
Herrliehe verliert niehts bei diesem Spiel, er gewinnt vielmehr'’
(p. 148). Gutmann, following a hint threwn eut by Lipsius, also
objected te the phrase ‘iuvenis admodum' as incompatible with the
ascertainable data ei the life ef Tacitus.

The supporters ef the Tacitean authorship, always few in num-
bers, had hitherto been forced te assume a defensive and apologetic
attitudc. The genuineness of the Dialogus was more er less an
article ef saith with them rather than a subject capable ef demen-
stratien ene way er another. Hewever successfully the claims ef
Quintilian and Pliny had been repulsed, there still remained the
palpable differente in style which the epponeuts never wearied in
pointing eut as the ene great argument, ‹lecisive against Tacitean
authership. The preblem thus presented could net bo ignered with
impunity ner explained en the ground that the author was still
