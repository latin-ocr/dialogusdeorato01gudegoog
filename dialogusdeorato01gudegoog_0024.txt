phasised and eonvincingly demonstrated. But the most valneblo
part of his trentise is the proof that chronological consideratione
render a later date for the composition of the Dialogus thau the

The ant-agonista oi the genuineness of the Dialogue having,

later work, though indispensable owing to the material aecumulated,
does not mark any advance. It is mai-red by a depici-abia diffuse-
ness nnd prelixity of treatment which obscures rather than
inusti-ates the issues involved and by an excessivo zeni which but
too often tempta the author to find eoineidenees, where nune exist.
