(8) Βεςιι-ᾶίις the stylistio coincidexwffl, it has already been
mmm-hed (p. xv) that the mere fact that the authorship of Pliny
no less than that ni* Quintilian has been based upon them, oon-
stitutes ι clear reductio ad absurdum of the hypothesis itself.

But thia in not all, for when we exa-mine thu oongeries oi illus-
tratiom mlleeted in 'deffllly parallel’ columns, by the exoessive
mal of Kleiber, Vogel, Grueuwald and Novssk,¹²' we find that fully

preoouoeived theory In the ease of a few phrases which Quintilian
and the autho! οί the Dialoguo seem to share between them, it
would he difficult, a similar idea once being given, to express it in
dissimilar language.

Finally, mid many genuine pmllelisms oi diction, we nt the
same time come upon most striking stylistic dimi-ganeas. Thus,
to mention but a. few inmanem, Tacitus is exceedingly fond of
nlliterative and synonymia eollocations, Quintilian habitually and
studimuly avoids them, while wnstructions such aa postquam with
plup. iud..y hahere with gerundive, dum with the pres. ind. in orat.
