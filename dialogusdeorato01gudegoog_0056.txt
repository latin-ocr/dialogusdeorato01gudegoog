and is found in the indelible impress made upon the mind of
Tacitus by the horrors of the reign of Domitian, for according to
Buffon’s famous phrase, “le style est de l’homme meme,’' and so
Goethe says “Im Ganzen ist der Stil eines Schriftstellers ein
treuer Abdrnck seines Inneren.'’ But if the man Tacitus neces·
sarily revealed himself in the stylist Tacitus, it was as natural that
the buoyant optimism of his youth should revel in the exuberance
of diction which characterises the Dialogus, as that a brief, suo
oinct, nervous, and energetic style should become the fit vehicle of
expression for the feelings of intense indignation which had taken
possession of Tacitus when, after the death of Domitian, he deter-
mined to devote himself to historical composition.

Still another reason for the change under discussion is the differ-
ence of the roipert-matter itself. A speech, a history, adialogue or
a letter call for distinctly different stylistic treatment, at least in
the hands of an ancient writer, for Latin, as well as Greek, though
perhaps in an inferior degree, by reason of an incomparable flex-
ibility of structure and elasticity of form, can be made to reproduce,
like a musical instrument, characteristic features of thought and
feeling. ln fact, it is only in music that we can find a modern
analogue to this unrivaled versatility of expression of Greek and

Latin, modern languages being far more rigid, less plastic aud inore
devoid of stylistic freedom. Hence we find the various species of
literary composition iu the classic tongues conforming to particular
types or generedicendi peculiarly adapted to the thought which
they are designed to embody,¹⁰⁸ aud the numerous ancient systems
of rhetoric, which to modern notious seem so often only the result
