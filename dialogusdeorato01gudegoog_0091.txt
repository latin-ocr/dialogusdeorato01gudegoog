The Dialogus de oratoribus purports to be, as we have seen, the lle· bidom
faithful reproduction from memory of a debate which the young fimum·
Tacitus had been privileged to listen to, and which, about seven
years later, after the death of the noted interlocutors, still scemed
to him of' sufficient interest and positive value ιο merit the atten-
tion of posterity.

The great majority of editors and critias, with the solitary
exception of Kleiber and Rausch‚¹²² tacitly assume that the author's
explanation of the origin of the treatise was given in good faith, a
lew only venturing far enough to concede at least the bare pos-
sibility that the debate in question may bc in reality essentially
unhistorical. 'Phe above-mentioned scholars dealt with this subject
only incidentally, and neglected many clear indications of the
correctness of their view. The following remarks will therefore
not be out of place.

The Dialogus‚,we contend‚ is a treatise cast into the dramatic
form of a debate by its author for the same reasons that prompted
Plato or Cicero to choose this particular species of literary com·
position. For it, and it alone, enabled thern thoroughly ιο discuss
asubject from all points of view, without ex cathedra utterances or
dogrnatic exposition. The grounds which compel me ιο look upon
the Dialogue in this light are briefly as follows:

(1) There is no instance of a similar work in any literature
which can be regarded as strictly historical. In all dialogical com·
position the author invariably exercises the right of the creative
artist to invent his characters and ιο place them in such situations,
as may be best conducive to the accomplishment of his object, but,
being an artist, he also endeavors ιο impart an air of verisimilitudo
to his creation by giving a kind of pictorial reality ιο the scenery
