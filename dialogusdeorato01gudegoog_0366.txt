11 0. Bmeii: Q. Roscius Gallus was born neas Ianuvium and
died shortly before the delivery of eicero's speech pro Archia (62
n. c.). He was by common oonsent, the greatest comio netur whom
Rome produced, the intimate friend uf Sulla, Hortensius and espe-
cially of Cicero, whose teacher he is said to have been (Plut. Cic. 5)
aud whose speech in his behalf (68 Β. υ.) is still exn-me. His art,
the result oi the most painstaking care und the profouudest study
(henne called 'doctus Roscius’ by 1-10r⁴ Ep. 11 1, 82) wag deemed
so perfect that his name became proverbial for excellence in general
(Cic⁴ (le orat. 1 28, 1³0 Brut. 84, 290 Festus 1). 289 M). Accord-
ing to Mavrob⁴ Sat. II 10, he was the author of a work in which
the art of acting nuel of oratory was compared, and Diomed⁴ G, L.
Ι 489, on the authority probably of Varro, says that Roscius was
the first tu introduce marks upon the Roman stage, an innovation
which Donatus, Praei. Ter⁴ Eun* p, 10 RA, however, dates as far
back as Ainhivius Turpio. The studied refinement and (lignity
which the Ciceronian period amuired in Roscius :md his great
contemporary, the tragedia„ Aesopus, appeared old-sashioned,
