slight sslfcontradiction oi Tacitus, moreover, seems also to betray
an earlier source. The author makes Messalla say that the time-
honored custom by which a young man would attach himself to
some great orator, had gone out of vogue in his day (c. 34 init), and
yet Tacitus represents himself in the introduction as conforming to
this very practico l Now this discrepancy is at once accounted ior
on the supposition that Tacitus is here simply echoing the views
of his ‘Quella' But be this as it may, deny, ii you will, that
neither Chrysippus nor Varro was directly consulted, the fact that
the chapters on education are not entirely original with Tacitus
must nevcrtheless, on the strength oi the evidence accumulated
above, be regarded as indisputable.

We have seen that the author oi the Dialogus is under the great
ost oi obligations to previous writers, notably Cicero, but in spite
of this wo cannot but admit that Tacitus, even in his youth, was
no serviis imitator, but that he assimila-ted his borrovved material
in such a manner as to make it practically his own,²⁰² admirably
succecdiug in producing a work, homogeneous in construction,
artistically elaborated in its style, and bearing all tho outward
indications of an original composition.
