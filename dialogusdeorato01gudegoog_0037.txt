the learned were stirred by the disputo regarding nominalium und
renlisin. The Prnnce of the 17th century is deeply sgitated by tho
momenwus question touching the superiority of the wisdom 01 the
ancient-s over that of the moderna. The was, ss often, ended in
a. oompromise. Perrault on his death-bed lncame reconciled ω
ΒοὶῙειιι. The same quarrel had been transplanted to England by
St< Evremonrh it is represented by Sir Win. Temple, Wni. Wotton
(Refleetious on Ancient and Modern Learning'), Dryden (ΡΙ-εἶκε
to his translation of the Aeneid)y Boyle »md Bentley, Swift (Ta-lo
of the Tub aud the Bettle οἱ the Books). There is scarcely a cun-
tempomry English writer οἱ repnte who was not drawn into the
frey aa 2 pnrtisnn. Then suddenly we henr no more of the dispute5
it had ceased to exist. In Franee, in tho 18th century, mother
very similar controversy arose in regard to the decline in teste and
the superiority of Homer as an epic poet. The works of Regnier,
Penelon, Herdonio, Aubignae, Termson, Bnffon, eto„ etc„ all resound
with the discussion of this pseudo-momentum issue* Finally, on
April 5, 1716, Mad.. Dacier and Ls Motte signed the articles of
peace, und the latter announceael in nn alleged poem to a breathlessly
expectant Academy, that the war was, indeed, ended, the victory
being, as usual, on neither side.⁴⁰

Now the controversy concerning the decline οἰ eloquenee, 1 con-

ennmerated. The identical question was diseussed in the days of
Demetrius Phalereus siml, in Latin literature, esp* from the wem·
decade of the first century, references to the smne topic meatus
nt every turn. Cp, εΔ g. Petronius in the very first chapter, Seneca
in his Introduction to the Controversiae, the younger Seneca in his
Epistles, und the anonymous author of Περὶ ὕψους in the famous
closing chapter. In the reign of Domitian these voices are liushed„
The controversy had, as in all the instanees cited, passed off the
stage* The very existence of Quintilian’s Institutio Oratoria bears
eloquent testimony to this iant. He does, indeed, preach a return
to the classic model οἱ Cicero to counteract the pernicious influenee
οὶ the emasculnted though scintillating style of Seneca, so popular

work, a more hopesnl, optimistic feeling had taken possession of
