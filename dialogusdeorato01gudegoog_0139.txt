PROLEGOMENA. CXXXV

other worda is not, whether ,iit ou the whole are nrore faithful
representatives of X, thau thani* ure of Υ, which may be
admitted, but whether the readings of X, more frequently than
Y, furnish what Tacitus wrote. Now it is very remarkable to
observc in how few instanccs AB or AB(D) have alone pre-
served the genuine reading as against evidcnt corruptions in
CDAEV, for even in those instaures where the context alone
does not help us to decide confidently in favor of one or the other
variant, we discover, on closer examination, that the stylistic
usage of the author shows ΑΒ to be in the wrong. Many variants,
again, in which X is pitted against Y, owe their origin solely to
the false solution of compendia, or to orthographical vagaries, the
scribes very naturally following the mode of spelling to which they
were accustomed or which they believed to be correct, without
regard to the MS. before them. Now all such divergences, be
they never so minute and apparently insignificant, are of no little
value, as will be seen from the above tables, in ascertaining the
iruemlaticaship between the MSS. themselves, but as far as the
question of the respective authenticity of their archetypa is con·
cerned, they are quite worthless.³⁸⁸

Ifirst give the list of variants of AB (X) vs. CDAEV (Y), then
ABD vs. CAEV, to which are added the few variants iu which the
genuine reading may be considered as doubtful :¹

Μ This applies especially to such variants as: his, hiis, iis; ille, iste, ipsc.
‘rbus AB show a decided preference for iste vs. ille in Y, and accordingly
Michaelis, true 1ο his exalted opinion of X, has everywhere, except c. 30 22,
written ‘iste‘ even where this pronoun is utterly out of place. Binde devotos
an entire chapter (pp. 23-28) to the discussion of these variants, his aim being
to show that Y followed certain principles, whereas X simply reproduced the
reading of its copy. But as these pronouns were abbreviated (1 cf. c. 194 33 22),
no inference ss to the greater trustworthiness of the X class can be legitimatciy
drawn. cp. Scheuer p. 33 f. note l. . In like manner, we must eliminate all
variants such as: nen, nec, neque (11), per, pro (pi.); que, quac, ἴῃ e, ae; 21112,
artes, diminuta, deminuta, eto. Others, however, like: constat, constaret,
videtur, videretur; fatebatur, fateretur, etc, although originally also due 1ο
compendia, may nevertheiess have been already written out in X and Y, and
they bave, therefore, been included in the above table. Scheuer (pp. 34-37)
admitted all these variants on a footing of equalityi Many readings of X or Y,
moreover, regarded by him as penetra 212 not so, while still others are uniustly
relegated 1ο the doubtful column.
