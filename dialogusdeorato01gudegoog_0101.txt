in the note ιο e. 37 ⁸, was undoubtedly a kind of oratorieal anthol-
ogy 15 so, it is in the highest degree probabis that seme other
similar details concerning the orators ef the Republie, especially in
those instanoes in which the Brutus οἱ Cicero could not have been
'tacitus’ som-ee, were culled from Mueianus‘ handy collection.

To this ¹ Quelle ’ 1 am disposed to assign the interesting passage
in which we are told that the great omtors of the Republic de-
livered no speeches before the centumviral court, Pollio's ‹selebi-atad
speeehee tor the heire of Urbinia constituting only an apparent
exoeption. See note to c. 37 14⁴

The other passage which, in my judgment, was taken troni the
*Actass is the close of e. 34, which gives the age at which Crassus,
Caesa-r, Asinius Pollio and Calvus made their oratorioal debut, md
the umes ot the men whom they presecuted un that occasion
Fer it will not be denied that it is intrinsically improbable to
suppose that Tacitus laboriously collected each single item from
indopmient and necessarily widely seattered sources, a hypothesis
rendered the more presai-inus, when it is remembered that eur
passage contains two palpable chronological errors, and that one of
these data (wnceming Crassus) is given correctly by Cicero in the
de orntore,¹¹⁸ with which dialogue our author, aa we have seen, was
very familiar. The detailed information bears all the marks οἰ
having been niue to some compendium or annalistic record of
litei-ary history. Several wei-ks ef this kind are known to ua.
But the Chronica οἰ Nepos were unavailahle, because they were
published before 63 arc„ and could not, therefore, have included
Pollio’s speech against C. Οῆιιη the Annales ef Atticus are also
excluded, because they constituted Cicero's source in the de oratore.
The Annales ot Fenestella recorded the dates of the speeches of
celebrated oratore, their ehronology having already in his day
become confused, as we may inser from a well-known passage in
Gellius-¹⁸¹ Taeitus may, therefore, have been indebted to this
