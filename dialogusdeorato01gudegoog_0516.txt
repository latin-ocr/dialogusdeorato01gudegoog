the superior eloquence of the ancients was but a poor compensation
for the anarchical conditions which alone had rendered its gros-th
possible. This is true, rejoins Maternus, bnt it should also be
added, that not even these orators themselves were allowed to enjoy
the fnrits of their reputation‚ for they all met with a violent eud
See hndresen ad loc.

‘tt pensare = compensare is postAug. Cf. e. g. l'ell. II 88 prae·

often. In Tac. in this sense only here. On the simple verb for

Maternus had occupied himself (c. 40) with an examination ol the argu-
ments of Secundus, which he had drawn from the political conditions of
the lle-public (c. :idq'li ext). Beginning with c. 38, Secundus discussed the
constitution of the lars'courts. Accordingly Maternus, following the same
order of topics, proceeds with a consideration of the statements in this
second part of Secundns' speech. This syrnrnetrically elaborated antithesis
and the constant polemical allusions to subjecta touched upon in c. 38 (see
the following notes) are, in nry jrulgnient, absolutely inexplicable on the
theory that Maternus was the speaker throughout. Cp. Proleg. p. lxxx ff.
