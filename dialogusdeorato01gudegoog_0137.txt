From this it uppem, then, that the mhetypon οἱ the Ottoboui-
anus νυ eonem-⁴1 by an unknown hami ηραν the Vindobonensie
had been copied from it, md in this emended state Fontanus οι·
the scribe οἰ the lemensis used it, the readings adopted being all
genuine.

There rema-ins the question aa to the inwmhtionship of an
ami the very frequent agreement of D with the X elasa. Thin
prohlem lma, in my judgment, also been solvet! by Scheuer. Fur
ι glanno at the readings given on p. cxxxi f⁴ will show that CAD
iorm still another independenl: group (designated by Scheuer as γ’)
οἱ Y. As for D, which Michaelis regarded as the best represent-
aive of the Y ela-ss, for the reasons giveny its frequent agreement
with AB* is now seen to be due to the fact that ite immediate
mhetypon (γ’) had been corrected out of some member of the X
family, after CA had already been copied. The eleas proof of thir
is fumizhed by the following significant variants:
