11 negotium is regarded by the commentatore as equivalent to
‘negotium forense' (so 0. 14 16 Quint. I 12, 7), as in Quint. IV 2, 27
XII 9,8 and in Tacitus c. 19 26 389Ann. II 27 IV 15 XIII4
XVI 22. But as Aper, with admirable urbanity, suppressos the
real object 01 Bassus' consultation 01 0 lawyer, it will be preferable
10 take negotium also as an intentional euphemiam. Translate:
‘should he become involved in some difficulty' or ‘meet with any
trouble! This meaning 01 nepotiana occurs in all periods 01 the
language 0. g. Plaut. Men. Va, 13 Ρο00. Ι 2, 30 Cic. ad fam.11110,1

12 recurret: ‘Will have 0000000010.’ Very rare in this sense
for the regular decurrere. Cf. Quint. Prooem. 17 ad auctores
recurrere, Ι 6, 13 ad earn rationem recurrunt. Here practically
equivalent to curret, for in Tac, as in Silver Latin generally, rc· in
composition is 01100 merely intensive. cf. G. 30 plus reponere in
duce quam in exercitu. Ann. XIII 57 residentibus flammis XV 73

Aper⁷s rclnctance 10 allude, save by irnplication, to the possible
contingency 01 0 troublesome lawsuit in which Bassus might figure
