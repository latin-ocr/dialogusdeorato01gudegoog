Ann. 169 VI 15. —in quibu-dnm: Quibusdam is here undoubtedly
neuter, not masc. (se⁴ oratoribus), as Peter centenas, for (1) the
swalletl ι’νι 'de smiptore' does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus.
(2) Even if it did, consistent usage would here require 'apud,' inas-
much as Aper does not include the entire works of the ancient
orators in his otherwise sweeping condemnation, but expressly
exempta some of the speenhes of Calvus. Cp. note e. 9 ⁰.

and refers w Cioero's exaggerated estimates of some of the old

passage is a clear reminiscenne of the Cicer-mian phrases, which
also show that 'tenere’ is not, as earlier editors erroneously main-

3 nee unum de populo etc: The meaning of this deplorably muti-
lated passage seems clear. Aper boldly declares that his censure is
not meant to apply merely to obscure third or fourth-class oratore,
whose desiccatecl style nevertheless found supportem, but to tho
most eminent as well. Unum de populo, like τῶν δι τοῦ ‹trouu-'i δῆμον
εἷς (Luciam, Somn⁴ 9), is equivalent to what Cicero in tlie Brutus
(quoted below) in much stronger language called the ‹li-ege οἱ
eloquenee. What little we know of the oratore here presumably
stigmatised, for the names themselves are, corrupted, has been
collected and exhaustively dismissed by Nipperdey, m«. Mus, XIX
