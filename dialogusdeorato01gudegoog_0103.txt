that Tuitus, here too, aa elsewhere, may simply have followed in
the footsteps ot one or more previous writers, aud ahin seems in
fut ho have boen the oue.

The educationi of children was frequently made ssiu subject of Chr-nimoc-
mmmgraphie treatment by the ancients, more particularly by the
Greeksst' The originale have unfortunaoely been entirely lost, οι
preserved only in mengre and insignificant fragments, but among
these Chrysippo& Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς seems ιο have been the most
exoensivexy used. 1oe popum-icy was not so much clue ιο any
originality of treatment, ntylistic char-m or profundity of observa-
tion, for the Stoic Chalcenterus was nut distinguished for nny οἰ
these qualities, but rather to the wmnnulation of the opinions of
otheru,¹¹¹ which could not hut make his compilatione a repository
of nseful information, highly welcome to later writer& We ase
weordingly not surprise-i to find that Quintilian, in discussing the
ednution of children, has recourse to this idenoeieal treatiso οἱ
Chrysippus, and, what has hitherto eseaped notice, that the un-
known author of Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς, which has come down ω us
under Plutarch's name, is also indebted ior'soine of his material to
the same Stoio wuree⁴ The indisputable proof of this is furnished
by the following pmages :
