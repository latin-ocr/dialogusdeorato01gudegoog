simis audientibus. From these and numerous other passages in
Quint. and Seneea, it follows thet Andreaen, John, Wolff and others
are wrong in identifying 'declamatorium studium’ with ‘arcana
semotae diotionis' in c. 2. For in that case, we should also expect
the phrase to have been transferred to the ¹ sed etiam ’ clause, sines
“non forensibus tantum negotiis (real cases) et decl. stud) (extre.
judieial pleadings) are clearly eontrasted with the ¹ disputati& of
Aper and Mnternus, interrupteni by the entrance of Messalla. —

takably indicate that the Dialogus is not the faithful reproduction
