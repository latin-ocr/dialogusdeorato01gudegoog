not help thinking that nature had rather marked him out for a
schola-r than for the active md less psaceful vocat-ion 01 sn advo-
ute, md hence we are not surprissd to lsarn that hs also devoted
himself ιο hismrical reseas-eh, and had published au admirable
biography uf Julius Africanus (e. 14 21 t).

ln tha present mutilated condition of the Dialogue, Secundus
scarcely figures as nn interlocutor at all< But that the author did
usign ιο him a much lsi-ger share in the conversation seems ιο mo
indisputsble. For the conspicuous manner of his iutroduetion, the
oureful description of the oratorieal ohsraetoristies of himself ancl
Aper, with whom he is placed upon s. perfect footing of equslity,
finally, the very phrase of the prooemium, 'cum sinquli , . . causas
fflerront,' no less tha-n the words in n. 16 Β pro duobus promitto:
nam ot ego et Sannaus exsequemur eas partes etc-,¹⁴⁵ render the
supposition that the author had nevertheless condemned him to
silence throughout the debete quite inconeeivable. But whether
his eontrihution ιο the discussion was lost in the large lacuna after
e. 35, which has been the opinion of some scholar-s, or whether we
still possess pest of it in the speech commonly assigned to Maternus,
is quite another snd more difficule question, which ws shall endesvox
to answer at the close of the chapter.

The lourth interlocutor, and the last ιο appear upon the soene, is
Vim-rmus Mannum· He was the only native Roman in tha Vtmw
φημι-ηρ» of xunstnons family, and probably a direct descendant ”must
of the famous M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus. This is nowhere
