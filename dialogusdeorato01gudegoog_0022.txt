supposed to attach to the troublesome and apparently irrefutahle
objections derived from the style 01 the treatise, they now happily
011 paled into ntter insignificance by the side 01 110 unimpeachable
testimony 01 0 contemporary of Tacitus! Quod volunt, credunt.
Among the many scholare who confidently and often in very strong
terms⁹ expressed themselves in lavor of the genuineness 01 the
treatise, may be mentioned Boeckh, Niebuhr, Hofman-Peerlkamp,
Dronke, Seebode, Ruperti, Bach, Ritter, Orelli, Doederlein, Schopen,
Nipperdey, Massrnann, Walch, Teuffel.

The consternation in the ranks 01 the opposition, caused by so
unexpected an assault upon what appeared to be a fairly impreg-
nable position, is well reflected in the absurd attempts made two
years later by Gutmann (1830) and subsequently by Fr. Hess, wh0,
though guided by different motivas, both endeavored to neutralise
Lange's argument by contending that the letter in question was
not by Pliny, but by Tacitus, it having by some strange accident
found its way into Pliny’s correspondence 1 It might seem incred-
ible, were it not for the reasons given above, that Lange's inference

should have blinded the eyes of scholars to its utterly fallacious
character for a quarter of a century, for it was not till 1855 that
Haase disposed of it by eonvincing arguments¹⁰ Two years after

'Teuffeb Introd. to his transl. p. 201, well voices the sentiment 01 oontem-
porary scholars : Die Zweiiel an dem Tacitcischen Ursprung unserer schrift. . .

¹⁰ The grounds upon which Pliny’s alleged testimony must be peremptorily
rejected may be briefly summarised: (1) The context 01 the letter can leave no
doubt that ‘quaere inter nemora et lucos commodissime perfici rrrras’ and
the words immediately preceding ‘quas ru ars pariter colendas etc’ refer to
one and the scine source, but the latter statement has nothing whatever 10
correspond to it in the Dialogus (2) The parallelism in question is a literary
commonplace as old as llesiod's Theogony, and the identieal collocation
‘nemora et lucos' isiound not only in other Tacitean passages but also else· ’
where. See my 8010100931, (3) Tu putas cannot possibly contain 0001οτ-
ence to the Dialogus, unless we absurdly suppose that Pliny totally overlooked
the 1001 that Tacitus etpresdy disclaims the thought in question as his own, it
being introduced 08 an opinion common to poete (ut ipsi dicunt). (4) Itis
incredible in any cose that Pliny would have quoted asentiment irom 0 treatise
01 Tacitus written fifteen years or more previous, for the adherents oi Lange.
with the exception 01 Nipperdey, 011 agree in assigning an early date to our
