Finally, the style οἱ the Diulogue exhibite most astonirhing resem-
blunees to the other writingu οἱ Pliny.

Tuae these stutemeuts are partly open to the gravent objections,
partly of no argumentative vulidity whatever, can be easily shown.
In the first place, Pliny was only 13 years old in 75 Am.. the
dra-matie date οἱ the Dialogue, which fact rendere his presence at
the discussion in the house οἰ Maternus an impouibiflity, not to
mention the trifling circumstance that a boy, and be he never oo
preconious, would not have been capable of following the converse-
tion with intelligentie. For, unhistorieal as the reported die-logne
unquestiombly ie, the author, we must remember, represents it aa
having actually taken place in his own presence⁴ Again, Aper and
Secundus, the leading advocates ot the period, are introduced to un
as the tenebere of the writer, to whom he was devotedly attached ς
Pliny, on the other hand, nowhere even alludee either to Aper or ιο
Secundus, but on the contrary expreesly informs us that he wan n
pupil of Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos ! ¹¹⁴

Still another argument against the Plinian author-skip οἱ the
Dialogus must be found iu the simple fact that Pliny himself
strangely faus to claim the beautiful treutise an his own, it being
not eo much us even casually alluded to. The siguificanee of this
argumentum ex silentio will be apparent, when it is remembered
that this vain author seizee every possible opportunity in his letters
w mention, ior the benefit of nn inquisitive posterity, nJl liternry
productionn¹¹⁸ that ever emauotetl froin liis busy and versatile pen,
even down to the mont trivia] doggerels.

Regardiug Pliny's style, finally, for it is tiresorne and needless
