Aper regards ss the only true eloquent-e. This view is confirmed
hy the gener-ic meaning of the word eloquentia in c. 10 18, where it
is made to include poeti-y as well as orawryi In order, therefore,
to resti-iet it to the latter only, distinguishing epithets such aa
virilis (ci. Cic. ad fmu- 1 9, 23 nam me iam ab emtionibus diiungo
fere referoque ad mansuetiora Musas) end oratoria were necessary.

Vahlen and Andresen that the same iden is here repeated in very
similar lnnguage, whereas we expect Aper to speflk of two occupe-

the author to depivt Api-r as a trained rhetorician who caresully
enumeratos the various subdivisions of his argument which he
subsequently discusses in regular order. Itis strange that John,
who makes the smne obser-vatim, did not see that it rendere his

last member of the second is mureover amplified to give a sonoruus
flnish. For exxi of this peculiarly Tacitean device, see the long
list in XVeinkauff, p* 92-97.
