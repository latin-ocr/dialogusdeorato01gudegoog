Ι un eunvinoed that the explanation given by Becker nnrl fol-
lowed by Habbe is the only true solution of the problenn but their
nrgumentation seems to hwk precision and oogency, ami has eon-
nequently failed to carry wnvietieu. Perhaps the following remarks
may euntribute something te the more general aeceptance of their
view.

The chief objection of the conservative critias against the essump
tion of a. lamma seems to be that the MSS* furnish no elue to its
existence. But the non—indication uf a lacuna is by no manns a
clear prees οἱ its nen-existence. For while it may be mdmitted that
the writer uf the uchetypou of mir MSS. may have been careiul
enough to leuve n vacant space, in the expectation that the missing
portions iuight some day be found, the scribes of a later age, uo
longer cherishing euch hope, would either content themselves with
a few dots or a vacant space, which in turn might be easily over—
looked by subsequent copyists, or else they would at once write on
eontinuousiy, thus wvering up aii signs οὶ an original gap. 'shut
this happened repeatedly in actual practice is a fact indisputably
established by pnlaeographieal reseaseh; nor mre such neglected
lacunae oonfined to the omissions of mere words and phrasesffl To
show the inherent weakness of the objection in question, it is only
necessary to ilraw attention to an instance very near at hand, which
hus nevortheloss been completely overlooked even by the supportem
of n second lacuna in the Dialogus. 1 refer to the condition oi Bk.
