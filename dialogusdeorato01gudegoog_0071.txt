Thia amusing paradox must, of oonrse, be rejected, but does the
alleged incongmity of e. 1-13 and 14-42, whioh gave riae to it,
really exist? Is the first part of nur twetise, aa scholars have
hitherto either tacitly or expreenly assumed, nothing more than e
kind of dmmntie »ming or framewnrk, deeigned primm-ily ιο bring
