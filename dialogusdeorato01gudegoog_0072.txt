structione. ‘Facundus,’ in the period under notice, is significantly
enough one of the highest attributes of the poet, while the very
term ‘eloquentis' is made to include all species os poetical com·
position (see c.1013). This being sc, the question must have
presented itself to so analytic an observares Tacitus admittedly
was, which of these two species oi literary composition, poetry or
oratory, was the more important, and hence, before entering upon
adetailed discussion of the causes of the decline of eloquencc, he
very appropriately introduces the orator Aper and the poet Maternus
in a prelinrinary debate concerning the relative superiority of poetry
and eloquence. The problem is purposely left unsolved. Why?
Because it did not admit of a solution, the author· clearly perceiv-
ing that in the literature 01 his day, oratory, so far aa it still
flourished, did so only by paying heavy tribute to poetry, while the
latter in its turn was distinguished by its oratorical character. In
other words, neither seemed complete without the otber; each was
regarded as essential to the other. Viewed iu this light, the intro-
ductory chapters become, in my judgment, an integral and organic
part of the dramatic plan of the Dialogue.

Oi the four interlocutors, but little in the way of concrete
biographical informaticn is known to us beyond what Tacitus has
thought it sufficient t0 tell us about them.

The host Cunrnrrus ltlnrnnsus is introduced to us in the double
capacity 01 a renowued advocate and a tragic poet oi great repnte.
He seems to have been a native of Gaul, although this is not
certain. He was undoubtedly the oldest in the company, having
secred a pronounced success as the author 01 a fabula praetextata
in the reign of Nero (c. 110). The time when the dialogue is
supposed to have taken place marks a turning point in his career,
as he announces his intention to retire permanently from the forum
and the har, in order to devote the rest of his days ‘far from the
madding crowd’s iguoble strife' to the peaceful cultivation of
the Muses.18³

He was very probably no longer living when the Dialogus was
written, for the opinion universally entertained down to very recent
times, that he is identical with a sophist of that name executed in

1⁸³ There is possibly some truth in Baehrens’ remark (Gcmm. Orat. p. tlh:
sd versus faciendos eum traxit animi mentisque indoles, in loro ut versarctur
causasque susciperet coegerunt rerum angustiae paupertasque.
