tation has always seemed to me singularly far-fetched and annat-
ural, and it may safcly be said, that no reader would ever think oi
understanding the words in question in this sense, unless he were
determined to nullify or at least to minimise at all hazards any
awkward evidence that may be found in the way of a preconceived
hypothesis concerning the authorship oi the Dialogus. If con-
sistent, Andresen ought also to have deuied that the words in a.

Tte date os Intimately connected with the dramatic (late of the Dialogue and

{mmm ina large measure dependent upon it, is the much disputed question

tion. regarding the date of composition. Steiner had, as we have seen,
greatly simplihed discussion by a clear alternative: Tanites either
wrote the Dialogue before ebe reiya of Domitian or he did aot write
it at αἷμ’ Accordingly, the opponente of the Tacitean authorship
directed their main efforts to prove that the Dialogue could not

have been written in the reign of Titus, for the makeshilt that the

composition and the publication were not virtually coincident
was justly rejected as intrinsically improbable. The arguments
addueed in support of a later date have been best formulated and
most persistently advocated by G. Andresen. It will, therefore, be

2⁸ This opinion is actually advanced‚ though still cautiously‚ by Steiner p. 24
aud stoutly advocated by ‚lansen p. ab. Both were doubtless intluenced by
Nipperdey's assertion that the Dialogus cannot have been written before the
death oi the interlocutors, and as Nipperdey and many others believed Maternus
to be identieal with the sophist oi that name, executed in tn, and that Messalla
istbe same as tha consul ol the year 115, the motiva which prompted the above
mentioned advocates oi Tacitean authorship to take the position they did,is
very transparent. We shall see that, even supposing Nipperdey’s contentiori to
be valid, there is no obstacle in the way oi regarding all the interlocutors as no
longer living iu 81 a. u.

believe so late adata to be perfectly compatible with Tacitean authorship. The
last named styles cur treatise “eine mit Bewusstsein vollzogeue kiinstlerische

does Schanz imagine that the consul Tacitus, the author oi the Agricola and
Germania, whose Historias were to appear a few years later, suddenly about
99 a. n. at the age oi 45 and tour years aiter the publication oi Quintiliau's
great work, took it into his head to write a rhetorical treatise, couched in
ciceronem phraseology which he called directty from Cicern's writings? This
seems to rue psycbologically improbable. Nou eadem erat aetas, non mens.
