the Tacitenn nuthership altogether or of aeoepting the peychologieal
impossibility that one ancl the same writer at one and the same
time was capable ot employing two kinds of style, so different as
that employed in the Dialogus and in the Agricola mul Germania.

The πρῶ-νυν finiam in this seemingly cogent end logical argumen-
tation is tha utterly unwartanted nssertion that the quaestor P.
Cornelius Tacitus, who at the early age of 23s24 had beoome the
son-in-Law of the consul Agricola, then in the zenith of his fame,
could not have designaterl himself as “ iuvenis admodum ¹ in refer-
ence to die time, when he at the ege of 20s21 was puxsuing his
studies under the guidanee of Aper and Secundus! The indis-
putable fect has, inoreover, often been pointed out that in no other
period of a man's life will even a few years work greater changes
than in the interval between youth and early mauhood, and if this
is the case with men οὶ average intellectual endowment, how much
more true must it heve been in a man οἱ genius, such as Tacitus
admittedly wa-s. Thai the greatest Roman liistorian received a.
most thurough rhetorical training, that he acquired high distinction
as an orator at an early age are facts denied by no one,⁵¹ and if any
doubt as to his precoeity still remained, it would be dispelled by the
following tamnus and osten cited letter of Pliny (VII 20, 3): erit
rasum et insigne dues homines aetate et dignitate propemodum
„equales nonnullius in litteris nominis alteruiu alterius studia,
fovisse, equidem adulescentulus (Pliny was born 62 Α. nl) euin iam
