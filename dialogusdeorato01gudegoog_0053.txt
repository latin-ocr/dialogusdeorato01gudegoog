while the writer oi the Dialogus is ‘duleis et candidus ct kunnu ille
vi [melior-J, hio voluptates And such, it is true, must be the super-
ficial impression which every reader will carry uwsy from n, pei-usal
of the histor-ital works and the rhetoriuul treatise, but it is, never-
theless, a one-eided one, because superfleisl. A closer examinatius,
as the above eoineiqlences, intentionnlly selected almost exclusively
from the Historias snd Annals, must heve made tolerably clear, on
the one hund utterly invalidam: the neeertiun of Lipsius md his
fouowexs that the Annals md our treatise, publishetl more then
thirty yeme previous, have alnulutely no stylistic features in com-
mon, while on the other, it as fully constr-ms Lipsius' dictum 'mutari

But it we must needs admit thet remarkable stylistic coincidunt-,es
exist side by side with equally remarkable stylistio divergenciee,
all objectione urged against Tacitaean authorship, quite independent
of the weighty internal evidence already adduecd, will be disposed
οἱ, if we finally suoceed in giving some plausible answer to the
following questions: (1) How carue Tacitus to write in the fluent,
exubere-nt, rhetorical style of the Dialogue ¹? (2) How came he to
abandon it for the nervous enei-gy, the studied brevity, and the
succinctuess of expression, thought-leden to the ver-ge of ubeeurity,
so characteristic of the Annnls ¹?

YVe have seen that Tacitus enjoyed n thorough rhetorical training
preparatory to the forensia career which he had chosm At the
time when the future historiari began his studies, Quintilian hlld
already started out on his lifelong crusmls against the styli-vt
Seneca by preaehing a return to the cha-ste and classic model οὶ
orator-³021 excellence which he saw typified in Cicero. Now even
if it were not all but certain that the young Twitus, like his friend
Pliny, had been s. pupil of the great rhetorieian, the treatise itseli
would prove that its suthor had at all events come under his influ-
ence, sor so far imru reflecting the stylistie rnannerisms of Seneca,
so much affected by the writers of the time, the Dialogus displays
nut only a protouud and extensive acquaintance with the works of
Cicero, aa we shall see, but its very diction is satursted throughout
with Cicerouiffll phraseology The documentary evidence of this
has been collected iu the Commentary, and the index locorum εΔ v.
