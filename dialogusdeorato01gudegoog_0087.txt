down to c. 40 8, including the certainly not inconsiderehle portions
lost in the lacuna, he would have given all the causes oi the decline

efter the close uf Aper’s speech‚- n preposterous suppositioniy un-
worthy of the literar-y artist who penned the Dialogue, and flntly
eontuudietaed, not only by c. 16 ὅ ff„ but also by the fact that
Messalla hed censed speaking at e. 32 ext, being prevailed upon
only nt the urgent request ui the host to bring his discussion to
its proper close. But what follows from e. ³6 on deels with en
entirely different subject 15, therefore, for the reasons given,
neither Maternus nor Messalla ean be the speakers of the part
between the two lacunae, there remnins only Secunda, the histo-
risn. How perfeetly in keepiug with his etteinments end convic-
tione the passages thus assigned ιο him are, must be clear from
the ioregoing remarks. We heve also seen that there ure other
strong grounds for believing that Secundus wna not relegnted to

fidene, be sufficient to dispone ot this objectiun also, as it proceeds
from n strange misooneeption of the attitude of the respective
speakers. For Secundus, alone of the interlocutors, though an
admirer of the meients, nowhere exhibite the uncompromising
antagonism toward contemporary oratory so marked in Messalla’s
answer to Aper, nor ngain does he extol poetry at the expense ot
eloquence, aa does Maternus in opposition to the same Aper.
