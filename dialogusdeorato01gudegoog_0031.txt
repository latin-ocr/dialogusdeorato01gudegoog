After dismisuing, in n few words, the evidence of the MSS. u
wortbless aud dealing with the alleged difficulties regar-<ling the
dmmatic date iu the traditione] wey, Andreseu proceeds ss follows:
The Dialogus cmiuot have been written during the reign of Domitian,
because it contains criticisms on men and mensures which could not
have beeu given publicity under thet emperor. Nor ensi it heve been
composed before Domitian, chiefly for two reasons, (1) The words
in the introductury chapter “quos eandem hane quaestionem pertre-
euntes iuvenis admodum audivi' sse unintelligible, unless we supply
in thought “and ss· a mature man 1 now reproduee in writing, what
Ι theu heard? but as Tacitus was 27 years old in 81 Δ. ιι, he could
not have designated himself¹ as ‘iuvenis adiuodum’ with reference
w the time in which, et the age of 21, he had listened to the debete

even grantiug that he possessed the requisite intellectual maturity

dead when Titus ascen-{ed the throne, but Crispus lived to a green
old age, highly esteemed by Domitian, until 93 ,ι υ, Hence uie
