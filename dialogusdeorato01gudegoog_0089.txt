parison with the known extent of the omission! in Pliny's letters,

In the determination of the eontents of the lacuna, seholars were
of course influenced by the view! whieh they held regarding the
degree of prominenoe given by the author to Secundus. Thone who
maintained that he did not speak at au wei-e unable to invent any-
