The MSS. have ‘secura velint‚' a reading uuiversahy rejected since the
time oi Rhenanus. As John (Berl. Plu. Woelreneclir. 1888 No. 46 and ad
loc.) has shown, an antithesis is imperatively called ior. This lact in itseli
disposea oi the conjectures oi Rhenanus and ll'alther. The remaining
emendatione, with two exceptione, all imply a lacuna between ‘scema'
and ‘velint' not a very probable supposition. Against Baehrens’ and
Vahlen's restorationa it may also be urged that the desire oi walae others
in danger cannot be given as the cause oi ‘altior et excelsior etc.‚' nor
does Lucret. in the famous passage oi the second book (1 a), which
would have to be regarded aa Tacitus’ model, speak oi desire but of actia-
sectioa: Suaue mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis Ι e terra magnum
alterius spectare laborem. The passage cited by Vahlen irom Seu. de ben.
1v 12, 2 abire in partem alteram possim et securus spectare aliena certa-
mina, at best but provee that the thought occurs elsewhere. Finally,
Vahlen’s and Halm's reading is too rhythmical (A. ,, J. ,,, J. ΙΙ vv,
J. oo, .'. υυ, υ J.) to be acceptable. The only emendation oi the
many proposed (p. 50) which seems to me entirely free irorn objections and
in every way satisfactory to tlre context, is that oi John, the remarkable
Greek parallelisrn cited above iurnishing an additional argument oi con-
siderable weiglrt in its favor.

Perhaps ‘existit’ (Betim-tt) or ‘extitit' represents the original reading.
