Dial in only two codices and of these one contains only Tacitean
writings! If any such transference had taken place, it was far more
likely that the name of Suetonius would have become attached to
our treatise, the more so as the Suetonian fragment also dealt with
purely literary topics. Xay more. on Haase's theory, we should
be compelled to conclude that, inasmuch as the Germania, preserved
in bnt a single MS, almost invariably follows the Dialogus, the
name of Tacitus was thence transferred from the treatise which
preceded Ε Again, it must be obserred‚ that many a work handed
down to us under a definite name, would hare to pass as ἀδέσποτον,
