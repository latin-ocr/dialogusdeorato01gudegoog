4 contum mnu: Messalla eurtly dismisses Aper's chronological
argument as irrelevant and is hence free to use a round number,
even though it may seem to favor his opponent’n ‹amatenizffiny by
still further nsrrowing down the short interval that has elapsed
between the so called 'mitiqui' and his own time.

5 de nabulo pugne: Similar military metaphora are frequent
ef. eg, Cic. «le fin. 11 1³, 42 Stoicis quibuscum bellum gerebat
(se. Carneades) de div. 11 51, 106 Quint. X 1, 105 quantam mihi
concitem pugnam.

6 quo elio nomine: e. g. veteresy prisci, olim nati—dum modo
θρωπε in Tacitus only here and G⁴ 6, 'dum' taking its plm in his
other writings.

7 in conluto: The same expression occurs c. 27 :⁵ and nequently
elsewhere (see Diem). On these and similar prepositional phrases,

minontiorsm. used flgnratively as in e. 1 2.

8 parti ‘passages—n eominu- letetur: This much disputed
passage seems to me perfeetly intelligible and unobjevtiunahle in
expression. Si for the more regular 'qua' is sufficientis supported
by the many parallel constructionis addueed by Vahlen, Prooem.

military metaphora immediately preceding, is somewhat boldly
hut appropriaoely here used of coming closer to the main point at
issue which Aper did, when lie made the remark (c. 18 7 f.) which
Messalla approvingly repente, sor the discussion which preceded
wat-³, in the speaker’s opinion, as we have seen, not germane to the
subject. On a perfectly analogous use of ‘commum' cf⁴ Cic. de

observes, a touch of sarcssm in these words, implying that Aper
had, with some flourish, mlduced zu nn original discovery what was
after all but a well-recognised truth.
