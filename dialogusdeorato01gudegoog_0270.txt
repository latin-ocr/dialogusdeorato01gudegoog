See Heller‚ Philol. LI p. 341. Hence ‘si ita res familiaris exigat’
is in its proper place, and Wolff's suggestion 1ο transpose the
phrase after ‘quidenn’ or Andresen's to supply it in thought, is not
only superfluous but not in keeping with the sense of the passage.
—gcnium propitiare: Here used in the sense of 'genio indulgere,
to enjoy the good things of life' Cf. Pers. V 151 indulge genio:
carpamus dulcia. These phrases embody virtually one and the
same idea—a fnlness of expression due to the speaker’s desire
to inculcata the importance of pursuing a profession which will
enable a man to acquire, as Aper himself had done, affluence, high
political positions and an enviable reputation, merely by his own
intellectual efforts and in the face of discouraging obstacles The
commentatore less correctly take ‘genium propitiare' in its literal
sense, in reference to the ancient superstition of tutelary spirits
(on which cp. Pauly, R. E. III 693 L. Preller, Ir'o'm. Myra. p. 566
Smith, Dict. Bioqr. II 241 1. and Kiessling, Hor. Ep. 111,143)‚
thus assuming that the poet Bassus had hitherto been involring the
good will of the ‘ genius' of another, which Ire is now called upon
1ο abendon in favor cf his own tutelary deity. With the thought
itself, cf. Sen. Ep. 15,10 quarn iucundum sit nihil poscere, quam
magnificum sit plenunr esse nec ex fortuna pendere, and Shake-
speare, Henry VIII ² How wretched is that poor rnen that hangs on
princes' favors!

29 adice quod, like ‘adde quod' forrned on the analogy of ‘accedit
quod’ (cp. nv. 11111496 Sclnnalz, Lot. Spar. p. 499), is first found
ln Liv. XXIII 5,9 adicite ad haec quod. Neither adice nor adde
quod occurs elsewhere 111 Tacitus. Cp. also Sen. Contr. IX praef.

3, once in Plin. Paneg. 53, 3. and Quint. II 17, 40 adiciunt his qui
contra sentiunt quod. 11 ie, however, especially characteristic of

the younger Seneca, but usually in the forrn ‘aulice nunc quod,’ e. g.

30 elaborare et efficere: Ea in rnnnposition, especially in such
words as elaborare and efficere seerns to add an intellectual elenrent
to the original rncaning. Cp. a. V. II 19 1. note 322, a vlew
