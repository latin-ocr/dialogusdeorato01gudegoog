as we must infer from the high official position and the oratorioal
reputation to which hc had already attained, was unquestionably of
sufficient intellectual maturity to grapple with a problem, in which
by reason oi his rhetorical training he would naturally have felt
an interest.

Now, if we can finally traoe an adequately striking correspond·
ence between the politioal, sooial and ethical convictione, the
criticisms on men and measures, the literary judgments found in
the historica] works of Tacitus and the Dialogue; ii even the style
should reveal remarkable aad numerous coincidences; if, in a word,
to use Lipsius’ phrase, ‘liniamenta quaedam apparent eiusdem viri
et vultus,’ we shall be forced to conclude that the cumulatius
weight oi these parallelisms of thought and diction will form a
chain of evidence in favor oi Taciteau authorship oi irrefragable
strength.

In the following some of the more salient coincidences of the
many pointed out or discussed in the Notas, are more conveniently
grouped together and classified.⁴²

(a) Politicul Views.

Sixteen years had elapsed between the Dialogus (80 f81) and the
Agricola (97), followed closely by the Germania (98). The Historias
were published between 105 and 109 and the Aunals about 115.
During this eventful period, the great historiari had seen seven
emperors come and g0; he had lived, in eniorced literary silence,⁴⁸

⁴³ Ag. 3 tot annis, quibus iuvenes ad senectutem, senes prope ad ipsos exactae
aetatis terminos per silentiam venimus. Non tauron pigebit rel incondito cc rrrdi
voce memoriam prioris servitutis ao testimonium praesentium bonorum com-
posuisse. This ianrous passage cloes not necessarily exclude a rhetorical treatlse
like the Dialogus any more than some or Tacitus' speechcs which were certainly
published in the reign oi Domitian, as we must infer from Pliny's letters. The
composition oi the Dialogus during that time is rendered impossible on intonui
grounds and the above statement oi Tacitus, as is clear irorn the context, refers
only to works oi a historiari description. Nothing is gained hy attempting to
prove too much, a iault into which many advocates oi the Taciteau authorship,
notably Weinkauii, have repeatedly fallen.
