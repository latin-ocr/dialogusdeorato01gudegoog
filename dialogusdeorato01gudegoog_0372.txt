This is the reading proposed by Gronovius on the basis of a passage
in eie. Brut. 69, 242, iu which one Q. Arrius, in spite uf his
orstorical mediocrity, is dealt with at some length, which drawa
from Atticus the impetierit remark 'tu quidem de susce hauris!

The father, a friend of Cicero and opponent us Anwny, is frequently
referred to in Cioero's coi-respondeum mul elsewhere, and is very
probably the person alluded to by Aper. His eloqueuce, in striking

eulogised in n passage of Plut. Ant. 58 Φουρνίου δὲ λέγοντος, Er ἦν

of the three or possibly four contemporaries ot Cicero of that imme
