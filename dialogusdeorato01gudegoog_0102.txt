author for his information, the errors included. But since the
data under notice sse of n nature extremely well suited to a work
such as we must conceive the ‘ Acta' of Mucianus to have been,
and as this collection is aprusly cited iu the Dialogue, it will bo
mors memodieal to assume this same publication as the direct
source of Tacitus, while Fenestella or Varro may possibly have
been among the informante ot Mucianus.

But not only were the ‘Acta' probably laid under oontributinn in
the two additional instanoes just dealt with, but 'Tacitus' indehted>
nese to the 'Epistulae' of Mucianus seems also not to hnve been
conflnsd to the passage in which they are cited, for 1 feel convinced
thst what we learn οὶ the spistolsry wax wsged between the ad-
herente of the Attic school snd Cicero (c. 18 21 ff. 25 2³ ff.) is
directly based upon this identical compilation, it being again
extremely unlikely that Tacitus had reeourse to the not easily
acoessible original letters of Brutus and Calvus‚¹¹³ when he might
have availed himself of Mucianus' lsbors. The same oonveuient
edition of these collected letters was doubtless used by Quintilian
and perhaps by Plutarch.¹''

1 must still diseuss one other possible source of Tscitus, to which
the Dialogus itseli, however, furnishes no direct or indii-eut clue.

The remarks on the eslucation of children, put into the mouth οἱ
Messalla (c. 28 fi), nre admittedly among the most interesting and
beautiful passages of the Dialogus. F. A. Wolf was, indeed, dis—
posedto regard them as the gem of the entire trentise, and even
Gutmnnn expressly exempts this portion from his otherwise dis-
paraging criticism Now the impression of a certain mstuxity of
judgment and experientes which these ohapters unquestionsbly
leave in the mind uf the reader, has led some seholaxs to think
that the author must have been more than 27 years ot ege when
this tirade against the laxity of contemporary educational methods
was written, frum which it would follow thet the Dialogue was not
composecl in the reign of Titus, and all that this inferenes implies
But the early date as well as the Tacioean authorship οὶ the
Dialogus rests upon too firm a foundation to be thus easily over-
tbi-own, for even mlxnitting, what is by no means certain, that
Tacitus st the age of 27 would not likely have given expression to
the views in questiony it does not seem to heve occurred to any one
