to multiply objections ¹¹¹ against the hypothesis under discussion,
it may be said that it bears ns much resemblance to the diction off
the Dialogus ns it doen to that of hin macher, Quintilian. Οἱ the
many so-called parallelisnui collected by Nast, Heus, Eckntein and
Vogel, by far the greater number, it munt also be obser-ved, belong to
the common vocabulnsy ui the langnage; others more particularly
exhibit the features of poet-Augurium usage and the stereotype
character of what may be called the rhetorical vernacula: of the
schoah οἱ the day. More important is the ssact, that amid so much
οἱ unavoidahle similasity, the diction of Pliny on closer inspection
dhplnys, when compared with the style οἱ the Dialogue, so many
inherent divergencies, as to render identity of author-skip quite
impossible.¹¹¹

&Milium The arguments advancetl in favor of Quintilian ¹¹¹ are substan-
tially based upon the same observatione and consideration aa some
of those just mentioned. They are, however, more numerousy moro
subtle and, aa tim ncn-Tacitean authorship of the Dialogus is ex
hypothesi complacently regarded aa indisputable, not without some
shadow of probability.

Lipsius and his folluwers were, it seems, primarlly lui-ed into
boldly declaring in favor of the great rbetoricicn, not so much by
atylistic considerations as by the fact emt Quintilian himself
repeatedlyn' refeis to a tmatise, published but a few years before
the Institutio, entitled da causis corruptae eloquentiae, for thio
title appeared to Lipsius, as we have seen, to harmoniae sn per-
fectly with the subject discussed in the extant Dialogus that he
lud no comples in identifying it with the lost treatise of Quintilian.
It is psycbologically interesting, in this connection, to obnerve how
completely a preconeeived opinion was nble to blind even so great
a critic us Lipsius to the palpnble fact that the very quotationn
from the 'cle causis corruptae eloquentiae ³ are not only not found
